Hello, in this task about flat state diagrams
we are given a short story of a puzzle of

0:00:07.370,0:00:10.540
a family trying to cross the river with a
boat.

0:00:10.540,0:00:16.340
In the first part of the task, we are asked
to give a static model of the story depicted

0:00:16.340,0:00:19.460
as a graph specifically.

0:00:19.460,0:00:23.810
That is, we need to think about which people,
objects, properties and relationships between

0:00:23.810,0:00:28.450
them are important in order to solve the puzzle
and which are not.

0:00:28.450,0:00:33.410
I am going to assume you already read the
story so I am just going to skip over it now.

0:00:33.410,0:00:39.540
And mark parts that are important to the puzzle
and therefore should be included in our model

0:00:39.540,0:00:45.350
and talk about the parts that might seem important
but really are not.

0:00:45.350,0:00:47.570
At least in terms of our puzzle here.

0:00:47.570,0:00:53.110
So, in the first sentence we have a lot of
set up information about where we are, who's

0:00:53.110,0:00:58.930
involved and what they are doing.

0:00:58.930,0:01:02.809
Most importantly here, we have the father
and his 2 daughters.

0:01:02.809,0:01:05.890
These are the people trying to cross the river.

0:01:05.890,0:01:10.580
And we know it is a sunny Saturday morning
in October, they are 31 years old and 9 years

0:01:10.580,0:01:13.580
old respectively and they hike through the
Lower Rhine area.

0:01:13.580,0:01:17.420
All of that information could be included
in the model.

0:01:17.420,0:01:20.960
But since none of these really changes how
the puzzle is solved.

0:01:20.960,0:01:25.079
We are not going to include it here.

0:01:25.079,0:01:30.600
Next note is, there is no bridge on the river,
this might seem very important.

0:01:30.600,0:01:37.070
Because this is the whole reason why they
are trying to cross the river with the boat.

0:01:37.070,0:01:39.930
But it doesn’t really change the puzzle.

0:01:39.930,0:01:43.560
Because the set up its, okay; they are trying
to cross the river over the boat doesn’t

0:01:43.560,0:01:48.890
really matter if there is a bridge 10 meter
away or 100 meters away, not.

0:01:48.890,0:01:52.750
We are still going to try to cross the river
with the boat, so this is also superfluous

0:01:52.750,0:01:58.030
information that does not need to be in the
model necessarily.

0:01:58.030,0:02:02.170
Luckily on the bank of the river, the family
meets an old fisherman with a boat.

0:02:02.170,0:02:09.740
This is the fourth actor or the third actor
if you view the daughter separately and he

0:02:09.740,0:02:10.740
has a boat.

0:02:10.740,0:02:15.300
This is important information because another
actor that is involved in the puzzle.

0:02:15.300,0:02:20.379
He needs to cross back and forth as well,
and the boat is the object of transportation.

0:02:20.379,0:02:23.850
So, this is important the fact that it is
small.

0:02:23.850,0:02:30.400
But we are getting more information on that
further ahead.

0:02:30.400,0:02:35.310
The fisherman agrees to lend them his boat
okay, it is just large enough to carry either a single

0:02:35.310,0:02:39.870
adult or up to two children, this is critical
information because this is basically the

0:02:39.870,0:02:45.790
cracks of the whole puzzle because not everybody
can cross at once, that would kind of make

0:02:45.790,0:02:47.599
this puzzle a little bit too simple.

0:02:47.599,0:02:50.700
So, can just carry a single adult or up to
two children.

0:02:50.700,0:02:54.870
So, this is definitely information that needs
to be in our model.

0:02:54.870,0:03:00.129
Both the adult and the children are able to
row, once again, this might seem very important;

0:03:00.129,0:03:07.040
but since there is nobody involved, he cannot
row and everybody can row, it is not really

0:03:07.040,0:03:10.569
an aspect that would fit well into the model
here.

0:03:10.569,0:03:16.549
Because then would have a note that says “okay,
people can row and that would connect to every

0:03:16.549,0:03:20.819
other actor” that is not really helpful
here, we are just going to assume there is

0:03:20.819,0:03:26.400
a cave that can row, everybody in our model
can row we do not need to specifically add

0:03:26.400,0:03:28.879
this to the model.

0:03:28.879,0:03:33.870
What is important however, is that the boat
will not move on its own.

0:03:33.870,0:03:38.189
Because then we could just send the boat back
and that would once again make the puzzle

0:03:38.189,0:03:39.189
kind of trivial.

0:03:39.189,0:03:44.010
Because then, two children can cross over
just push the boat back and then a single

0:03:44.010,0:03:45.760
adult can push the boat back.

0:03:45.760,0:03:49.400
And the fisherman just stays there.

0:03:49.400,0:03:53.319
The boat pushed back again that would make
this puzzle a little too easy.

0:03:53.319,0:03:58.329
So, this is definitely critical information
as well.

0:03:58.329,0:04:00.319
How can the family cross the river with the
boat?

0:04:00.319,0:04:06.189
This is the question the puzzle is asking
and importantly here at the end the fisherman

0:04:06.189,0:04:11.510
wants to be back on the same bank as he was
in the beginning, with his boat of course.

0:04:11.510,0:04:16.470
So, we somehow need to put in our model that
the boat belongs to the fisherman, and he

0:04:16.470,0:04:21.400
wants it back with him on the side he started
off.

0:04:21.400,0:04:29.250
So, now that we have marked all the important
information in our story.

0:04:29.250,0:04:31.940
We can start drawing our graph.

0:04:31.940,0:04:39.880
We are going to start by just revolving everything
around the boat.

0:04:39.880,0:04:44.850
You can do this differently and of course
this is left intentionally vague ( here to pick

0:04:44.850,0:04:48.390
him off) as a graph it does not say what graph
it is.

0:04:48.390,0:04:54.770
The important part of this task is for you
to think about what is important to be involved

0:04:54.770,0:04:58.190
in the model such as this and what is not.

0:04:58.190,0:05:05.030
How the graph looks in the end does not quite
matter as much as what information the graph

0:05:05.030,0:05:06.030
contains.

0:05:06.030,0:05:12.630
So, do not worry about if your graph ends
up looking differently, it very well might

0:05:12.630,0:05:14.660
look very differently.

0:05:14.660,0:05:19.630
As long as the information that is important
is in there and there is not too much superfluous

0:05:19.630,0:05:22.650
information you are going to be fine.

0:05:22.650,0:05:29.000
So, for my graph I am going to start by putting
in note for the boat itself.

0:05:29.000,0:05:35.160
Because everything kind of revolves around
the boat, how many people can ride in it etcetera,

0:05:35.160,0:05:38.190
where the boat is going to end up and where
the people are going to end up.

0:05:38.190,0:05:43.169
So, I am going to start by just drawing the
note for the boat.

0:05:43.169,0:05:44.910
Next up we have two sides of the river.

0:05:44.910,0:05:51.470
So, we have the gold side, we are going to
call it the other side here where the father

0:05:51.470,0:05:56.919
and his two daughters want to end up at and
the starting side, where the boat and the

0:05:56.919,0:06:01.370
fisherman need to end up in the end.

0:06:01.370,0:06:06.120
Because they are going to stay in the starting
side as given in the story.

0:06:06.120,0:06:11.130
Next up of course we have our actor, we have
the father, and we have his two daughters,

0:06:11.130,0:06:14.690
you might separate the daughters into two
notes here.

0:06:14.690,0:06:18.009
But that is not strictly necessary here.

0:06:18.009,0:06:22.169
Because in terms of the puzzle, the daughters
are identical basically.

0:06:22.169,0:06:27.789
They even have the same age might be a bit
reductive to think about it person as having

0:06:27.789,0:06:33.350
properties and two children being identical.

0:06:33.350,0:06:38.940
But just looking at this in terms of the puzzle,
the daughters are identical and can be combined

0:06:38.940,0:06:45.620
to a single note here, or of course we can
put two separate notes.

0:06:45.620,0:06:46.650
Next up we have the fisherman.

0:06:46.650,0:06:48.900
Of course, on the boat.

0:06:48.900,0:06:50.560
And he is critical to the story.

0:06:50.560,0:06:54.979
Because he is going to be riding back and
forth as well.

0:06:54.979,0:06:58.490
Then, of course we have all the information
about the properties between them.

0:06:58.490,0:07:01.200
We have the fisherman fit alone into the boat.

0:07:01.200,0:07:06.970
So, I am just drawing an arrow here pointing
at the boat and saying with an annotation

0:07:06.970,0:07:09.100
“the fisherman fits alone into the boat”.

0:07:09.100,0:07:16.220
So, that kind of implies that can cross alone
and nobody else fits in.

0:07:16.220,0:07:21.509
Next up the father of course, he has the same
property, he fits alone in the boat.

0:07:21.509,0:07:25.740
And the two daughters fit together or separately.

0:07:25.740,0:07:30.310
The text only says, “can carry a single
adult or up to two children”.

0:07:30.310,0:07:38.099
So, this kind of implies that 1 child can
also-, or one daughter can also cross by herself.

0:07:38.099,0:07:42.280
Which is definitely going to be necessary
in order to solve the puzzle.

0:07:42.280,0:07:46.520
Then, we have the information about where
everybody ends up.

0:07:46.520,0:07:48.620
The fisherman should end up in the starting
side.

0:07:48.620,0:07:50.150
Same with the boat.

0:07:50.150,0:07:55.100
And the father and daughters end up in the
other side.

0:07:55.100,0:07:57.180
And that is our graph basically.

0:07:57.180,0:08:00.150
This contains all the information that is
important to the story.

0:08:00.150,0:08:07.020
We have our actors: we have the father, the
two twin daughters, the fisherman, the boat,

0:08:07.020,0:08:09.300
where are they going to end up.

0:08:09.300,0:08:14.759
And who can fit into the boat at the same
time.

0:08:14.759,0:08:20.509
Crossing the river could also be modeled here
but it is not strictly necessary.

0:08:20.509,0:08:24.180
Like I said, your graph might end up very
differently to mine.
