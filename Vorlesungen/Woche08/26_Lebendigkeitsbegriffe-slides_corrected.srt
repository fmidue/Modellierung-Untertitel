161 # slide
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
So, welcome back.

00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:10,080
We will now deal here
today with properties of Petri nets.

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,400
I had already announced this at
the end of the last lecture.

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,020
As a reminder:

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,050
We had last dealt with
reachability graphs, respectively with their construction.

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,440
That was the example
from the last lecture.

00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,160
There was this Petri net, and I
had set up the reachability graph for it.

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,320
And based on that, I
had already intuitively discussed some properties.

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,250
For example, the fact that
there is a dead end here.

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,290
That you can get into a situation
where the Petri net can't fire anymore.

00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,490
But I had also
discussed other properties here.

00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,550
These are, of course, properties
of the Petri net, actually.

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,160
But we can recognize them
in part better or at all

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,340
by setting up and
analyzing the reachability graph.

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,780
It will be the same for
the properties we are looking at today.

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,850
They will be properties
of Petri nets, but

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,540
they will be discussed or
defined on the reachability graph.

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,380
And we will start
first with terms related

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,490
to liveness or
even non-liveness, deadlock.

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,880
Later, other properties will be added.

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,850
But the first small family of properties

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,860
will be about liveness and its opposite.

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,000
There are several terms there, and the
first one is not just called "liveness",

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,310
but "strong liveness".

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,290
Here is the definition first.

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,890
So a Petri net is called "strongly live"
if .... and then there is a definition here.

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,240
So it must hold that for every
single transition t (the Petri net can have

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:09,990
several transitions, after all) and for every marking
reachable from m0 (we remember, m0 was the

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:16,130
starting marking), let's call that
m, there is a marking m',

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,200
which in turn is reachable from
m, and for which t is activated.

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,330
This is a multi-level definition:

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,180
For every t and every marking m reachable

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,490
from m0, let there
be another marking m', etc.

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,240
What does this mean intuitively?

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,100
Basically, it means:

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:44,750
Let the Petri net
run arbitrarily from the initial

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,020
marking without thinking of
any special transition t.

00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,190
So you let it run first.

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,730
At some point one says
"Stop" and has a marking m.

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,690
Now it must be possible to continue
working from there (wherever you are) in such

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:08,480
a way that at some point you
still have the opportunity to fire t.

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,930
It must not be possible that
on the way from m0 to

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,480
m one has somehow maneuvered
oneself into a corner of the

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,230
reachability graph, from where one never
again gets the opportunity to fire t.

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,610
Then the Petri net is strongly live
if that holds for every transition t.

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:34,170
This means, of course, that then t can
be fired arbitrarily many times, infinitely many times.

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,600
But this is not
all that the property says.

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,550
Strong liveness is indeed
a very strong notion.

00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,220
One can read off the
property from the reachability graph.

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,690
One can also transfer what is written
here in the definition to the reachability graph.

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,700
Then it is ultimately said:

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,560
From each node of the graph a transition
must be reachable which is labeled with t.

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,990
From "every node of the graph", that
is just all markings reachable from m0.

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,690
So if we say, "for
every marking m reachable from m0",

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,420
that is equivalent to saying,
"from every node of the reachability

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,120
graph" (there are only
reachable markings in there).

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,540
So from there, you have to be able
to get somewhere where t is activated again.

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,290
That is, from each
node of the reachability

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,990
graph, another node must be
reachable, or perhaps the same node,

00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,260
from which a transition
can be made with t.

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,910
This corresponds to the
fact that t is activated.

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,870
For example, is this true for
our example Petri net from last week?

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,130
For this Petri net?

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,210
Does this have the property that
if one makes any transitions (any

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,310
number, any length) starting
from this starting marking m0,

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,010
it is guaranteed that in
whatever marking m one is

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,480
then, a marking m' is reachable from
there, where t1 is fireable, for example?

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,070
Or conversely, we first
fix on t1 and ask:

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,920
Is it the case that for every
reachable marking m it is then still possible

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,630
to reach an m' from which t1 is fireable?

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,910
And for t1 the answer must be
"yes", for t2 the answer must be "yes",

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,530
for t3 the answer must be "yes".

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,190
If for all three the answer is "Yes" in
each case, then this Petri net would be strongly live.

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,220
You can then think about this here:

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,180
What happens if I fire here?

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,260
What could happen?

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:31,530
Can I guarantee that I
can always fire t3, for example?

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,360
We can answer that
on the reachability graph.

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,950
Is it true here that
from any node it is possible

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,460
to reach a node where t1 is fireable?

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,710
No, it is certainly not true
because there is the dead end.

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,730
So we take as t our t1.

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:05,350
Then it is indeed the case that there
is a marking m reachable from m0, and

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,000
starting from it there is no
m' in which t1 is fireable.

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,230
So starting from this node
there is no reachable node

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,410
from which t1 or even
t2 or t3 can be fired.

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,160
In that case, it would not even
matter whether one focuses on t1, t2, t3.

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,390
Because it is the case for
all three that there is at least

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,620
one node, this one, from which you can
never fire t1 or t2 or t3 again.

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,420
And it's not the only dead end either.

00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,030
For every dead end
in this reachability graph, we

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,630
would have this phenomenon that, of
course, transitions are never executable again.

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,040
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a dead end.

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,370
That is, related to this Petri net:

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,850
You can have
"deadlocking" sequences here.

00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,340
That will be somehow, if here for
example t2 and t3 are not fired sensibly,

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,320
alternately; but after firing t1, then
there would be here below two tokens,

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,990
for example these both with t3
moved up and thereby prevented that

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,800
t1 is ever fireable again; and then
of course also no other transition.

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,820
So here the answer would actually be
that this Petri net that we have

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,950
seen is not strongly live in that sense.

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,470
That would be "strong liveness."

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,090
If there is "strong liveness",

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,130
then surely there is also
a notion of "weak liveness".

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,860
And perhaps our Petri
net at least fulfills this.

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,350
So what does "weak liveness" mean?

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:36,970
A Petri net is weakly live
if for each transition t there

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,700
is a marking m reachable from
m0 for which t is activated.

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,160
With strong liveness it was said
that for each transition t and each

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,990
marking m reachable from m0 it is
the case that one can still fire t at some point.

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,040
While here it is only said:

00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,760
For every transition t there must
be a marking m reachable from m0

00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,765
for which t is activated.

00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:56,140
And not:

00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,290
For every marking m reachable
from m0 it must be possible

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,570
to reach m' for which t is activated.

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,090
So this is a weaker requirement, because here
you can make a convenient choice, so to speak

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:14,530
So as the person who wants to
try to prove that a Petri net is

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,560
weakly live, here one can sort of
choose a favorable reachable marking from m0.

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,980
Whereas with strong liveness, the
property must hold for all markings

00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,740
reachable from m0, including
perhaps unfavorably chosen ones.

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,450
Therefore, this is definitely
a weaker property, which

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,290
therefore potentially more
Petri nets can satisfy.

00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,670
What does the property say
in terms of the reachability graph?

00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,200
It simply means that every transition t
must occur at all in the reachability graph.

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,940
So if a transition t is drawn in the

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,210
Petri net, then it must
also occur in the reachability graph.

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,790
Because the reachability
graph covers all firing sequences

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,940
which are possible
from a reachable marking.

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,750
So the requirement "there must
be a marking reachable from

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,590
m0" is equivalent to "there must
be a node in the reachability

00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,560
graph" from which one
can make a t-transition.

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,200
Then we can look again:

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,410
Is this now the case
for our example Petri net?

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,190
You can see that
already in the Petri net:

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,130
Here we actually know, we
have already seen firing sequences where

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,710
t1 has been executed, as
well as t2 and t3.

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,890
If we fire t1, we can then
fire t2 and then also fire t3.

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,260
Then we have fired
all transitions at least once.

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,460
And that would be enough to
detect weak liveness of the Petri net.

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,460
Or we look at the
reachability graph and ask ourselves:

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,560
Does every transition t1, t2,
t3 occur here at least once?

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,320
Then we see: yes, t1
here, t2 here, t3 here.

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,920
That would be enough.

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,750
Thus weak liveness would already
be present in the example.

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:16,650
In order to be able to check
this (this is also true for strong liveness),

00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,770
the reachability graph should be finite.

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,120
We know, in general,
reachability graphs can be infinite.

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,170
This check for strong or
weak liveness is possible if

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,420
the reachability graph is finite.

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,600
Weak liveness can often be easily
decided even for infinite reachability graphs,

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,010
if already in a finite
part of them all transitions occur.

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,100
For this it is only
important that each transition occurs once.

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,881
So if you have a Petri
net and the reachability graph partially

00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:56,910
already; if you just start to develop
the one you may not have finished developing

00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,850
(because it may not be possible in finite
time, because it has infinitely many nodes); but

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,020
if after finite time you have already
seen every transition once, you can already say:

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,260
The underlying Petri net
was at least weakly live.

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:13,020
To also prove strong liveness, one would
have to know the entire reachability graph.

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,040
And this is of course
difficult with infinite reachability graphs.

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
That would be "strong and weak liveness."

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,490
What we have seen here is
that a Petri net can be weakly

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,800
live even though it
contains a deadlock, a

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
marking from which no
further steps are possible.

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,250
That does not
argue against weak liveness.

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,230
It does, however,
speak against strong liveness.

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,890
And this kind of deadlock, impasse,
of course it also has a definition.

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,510
Even if we have
already intuitively seen what

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,600
it means, and perhaps don't
need a formal definition at all.

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,280
Nevertheless, here once written down:

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,490
So a Petri net is
said to have a deadlock (or

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,510
so far I had sometimes said dead end)

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,550
exactly when there is a marking reachable
from m0 for which no transition is activated.

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,460
Of course, equivalently
for the reachability graph,

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,220
this means that there is a
node from which there is no transition.

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,660
So this corresponds exactly to
our informal question about dead ends.

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,060
It also means that this Petri
net contains at least one deadlock,

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,980
and we see that, for example, in
the reachability graph here, but also here.

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,030
To say "there is a deadlock" or
"the Petri net is not deadlock-free", it

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,640
is enough to have detected a deadlock.

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,410
In fact, there is
also the term "deadlock-free".

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,170
This is said when a Petri
net does not contain any deadlock.

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,760
Which is important, which is often
done wrong in the exercise or exam:

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,290
This deadlock term says
exactly what it says.

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,390
So it doesn't say, for example,

00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,170
that somehow there is a place
from which there is no arrow.

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:04,290
This is often misinterpreted by
students, and then they argue

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,850
that the Petri net is deadlock-free or
not, and then they focus on whether

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,620
there are places in it (i.e.
circles) from which there are no arrows.

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,490
That is not the criterion.

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,780
The criterion is what is written here, or

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:22,200
that there are nodes in the reachability
graph from which there is no transition.

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,900
That is, nodes from
which there is no continuation.

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,310
That is the criterion for deadlock.

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,780
Not somehow a reference to
places in the Petri net itself.

00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:36,990
To be able to check that, again it
is important that the reachability graph is finite.

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,050
This check, in this way, requires

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:46,020
the reachability graph
to be searched completely.

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,400
And that's only possible if it's finite.

00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,680
This also means that you can only answer
something like this, in the exam for example, for

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,770
finite reachability graphs or for
Petri nets with finite reachability graphs.

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,850
But of course the definition
is also generally applicable, it is

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,932
just not so easy to check then.

00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:09,030
This is our example from before,
we don't have to do anything else.

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,130
We don't need to look
at it again in more detail.

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,370
I had already referred to the dead ends

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,320
when I discussed or rejected
the strong liveness for the example.

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,900
What else is there to say?

00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,010
So what does it even mean, "strong"?

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,350
Why is the
"strong liveness" called strong?

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,140
Because it is stronger in
sum than the weak liveness.

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,610
So, in particular, it is
true that any strongly live

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,280
Petri net is both
weakly live and deadlock-free.

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,180
And vice versa:

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,020
A Petri net that is not
weakly live cannot be strongly live;

00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,370
a Petri net that contains
a deadlock cannot be strongly live.

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:57,300
This is true because we do
not have transition sets that are empty.

00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,130
If we also allowed
empty transition sets in Petri

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,810
nets, then this statement would
hold here only with a precondition.

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,080
This would be a very
artificial case of having Petri

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,750
nets in which there
are places but no transitions.

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,650
Then, formally, the Petri
net is definitely strongly live,

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,330
and then this statement would not hold.

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,950
Since it would then be
both strongly live and deadlocked.

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,400
But we consider, we
have intentionally defined, Petri

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,670
nets only for non-empty transition sets.

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:34,230
And then the statement holds as
it stands here, and there's this clear

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,785
connection of strong to
weak liveness and deadlock-freeness.

00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:50,880
Okay, we've just discussed
this on the one example.

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,490
I'm going to discuss in a moment in
a separate video with examples in my whiteboard

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,710
app of different combinations of the

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,520
different properties in terms
of liveness and deadlocks.

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,960
So looking at simple artificial
examples where certain combinations occur.

00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,790
In particular, it will also be
a matter of clearing up the

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:21,150
misconception, which is also widespread and is often voiced
in exercises or the exam, namely that deadlock-freeness,

00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:27,570
so to speak, is precisely
the difference between strong and weak liveness.

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,290
It is true that from
strong liveness follows weak liveness

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,600
and deadlock-freeness.

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,890
But it is not true that, so to
speak, exactly these two things must be present

00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,480
for strong liveness to hold.

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,580
These are independent qualities
in a certain sense.

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,490
But we will be able to make this
clear to ourselves with the concrete small Petri nets.
