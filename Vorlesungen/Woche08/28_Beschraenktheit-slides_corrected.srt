00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,030
Just now we were dealing with liveness
notions, i.e., properties of Petri

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,240
nets that have something to do
with liveness (in various degrees).

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,870
And this was about the structure of the Petri
net or the corresponding reachability graph.

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,620
Not about the numbers that were in there.

00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,980
So it was not about the number
of tokens on single places.

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,090
But it was about whether certain
transitions are executable, again

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,010
and again or at least once.

00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,370
Whether a node can be a dead end.

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,920
So in the end it was about
the structure of the graphs,

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,250
not about the content of the
single places in a marking.

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,620
So it wasn't about numbers.

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,760
That's changing now.

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,410
It's now about properties that have
something to do exactly with those numbers.

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,650
That corresponds to the
informal questions from earlier

00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:01,650
in the lecture, about bounds or
capacities of individual places.

00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,620
So do we want that
there can never be more than

00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,930
so-and-so many tokens in
one place, for example?

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,290
This would be expressed in the
reachability graph by the fact that in

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,750
the tuples that we write into the

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,360
nodes, for example, the individual entries
can never exceed a certain number.

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,430
This is about
the concept of "boundedness".

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,830
And there is first of all a term,
which is called "safe" or "1-safe".

00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,210
And it's first defined here on the slide.

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,610
So a Petri net is
1-safe if the following holds:

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:55,770
First, for every transition t and every place
s that the Petri net has, this expression, the

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,990
preweight function of t applied
to s, is less than or equal

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,630
to 1 (that is, zero or one; negative is

00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,750
not possible anyway, here we only
assume natural numbers including zero).

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,960
So if it says "less than or equal to 1",
it can only mean: either zero or one.

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,650
Either there is no transition at all,
no arrow in the Petri net from this

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,160
place to this transition (and then
from there perhaps into other places).

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,260
Or, if there is a connection there,
it is one without an extra weight,

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,570
just a simple arrow with weight 1.

00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,520
And the same is
true for the post weights.

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,800
So for any t and any s, the

00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,120
post-weight function of t applied to
s also has the value at most 0 or 1.

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,010
So all weights at most 1.

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,547
This is first a structural
property of the Petri net.

00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:45,980
I can look at the
Petri net and ultimately see:

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,480
Is there something else, something greater
than a 1 attached to a weight somewhere?

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,410
In addition, a
dynamic property also applies.

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,490
Namely, even in the reachability
graph, it must be the case that every

00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,540
reachable marking (i.e., the m0 itself, but
also every marking that can be reached from

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,760
there) also has the property that for
every place that the Petri net has,

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,330
the marking for that place
gives a value of 1 at most.

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,390
That is, if we have the tuple
notation of our nodes (of the markings

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,980
in the nodes), then there must never be
a component there that is not 0 or 1.

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,900
Thus we can already say quite
clearly, as a simple example, that

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,340
for example this Petri net is not 1-safe.

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,150
We can see this immediately, because
it has for example a 2 here, and also

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:43,490
because the start marking has more
than one token on at least one place.

00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,770
So already here you would see that to
the Petri net in this representation.

00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,030
Of course, we could also look
at the reachability graph.

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,620
And there we see immediately, especially
already in the start marking (but also in

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,890
other markings) in any case
numbers greater than 1.

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,790
So this is quite blatantly not
1-safe, for various reasons.

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:13,070
Both concerning this fact, that
this 2 is here for example, and

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,470
because of observations
about the reachability graph.

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,020
If a Petri net may be called "1-safe",
it must have both the property that there

00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,400
is never a number greater than 1 as a
weight in the Petri net representation, and

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,890
that every reachable marking
(i.e., every node in

00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,720
the reachability graph) must not
contain anything greater than 1.

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,940
This is indeed a very strong restriction.

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,900
Of course, "reachable" here means
"reachable from the start marking".

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,570
Now I have discussed an example
that is blatantly not 1-safe.

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,360
Are there also Petri nets that we have
already discussed that are 1-safe?

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,170
Yes. Those were all 1-safe Petri nets.

00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:00,170
Here, there are never any weights
greater than 1 in the representations

00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,120
of the Petri nets themselves, and if you
look at the reachability graphs for these

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Petri nets again in the previous video, you will
never find a component greater than 1 there either.

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,200
Therefore, these have actually all
been examples of 1-safe Petri nets.

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,470
This check that there is
never anything greater than

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:28,310
1 in the reachability graph is, of course, only
feasible if the reachability graph is finite.

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,580
But it will be if this property holds.

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,860
So this refers to "1-safe": weights

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:44,180
only 1, each marking contains only
at most one token per place, etc.

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,890
This is very limited.

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,600
Actually "1-safe" or "1-bounded",
but it's called "1-safe".

00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,850
Besides that, there are other notions of
boundedness, which also allow larger values.

00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,660
Which in particular do not restrict the
weights in the Petri net itself already.

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,020
But they only restrict
that the markings in

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,010
the reachability graph must
be bounded by a constant.

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,600
And this does not necessarily
have to be the constant 1.

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,780
So a Petri net is

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,150
called "bounded" if there is some
constant, some natural number.

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,370
This can be 1, of course,
but it can also be 15.

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,930
And what should be valid?

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,430
For this constant it should be valid that
every reachable marking m, i.e. every

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,550
marking reachable from m0, has the property that for every
place s (i.e. in every component in tuple notation) there is a

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,921
number which is at most c.

00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:37,750
If c = 15, there
should be no number greater than

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,140
15 anywhere in the reachability graph.

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,490
If there are only numbers up to 15,
then the Petri net would be bounded.

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,370
And what weights are in the Petri
net itself does not matter at all.

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,540
So here only the reachability

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,020
graph and the reachable markings
are referred to.

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,550
And that can be determined
in the reachability graph.

00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,740
And for this there is the
opposite, namely "unbounded".

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,160
A Petri net is unbounded
if this is just not true.

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:14,500
But if for each constant c there is a
marking m reachable from m0 and a place (not

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:21,820
all places, but one place) so that
actually a value larger than c is realized.

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,780
So "bounded" and "unbounded" are actually
the exact opposite of each other.

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,910
While "1-safe" is not somehow
opposite of either property.

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,250
How could one test this?

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,440
How could one test these properties?

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,570
Well, first of all, of course, it is true
that every 1-safe Petri net is also bounded.

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,120
One could test for boundedness first.

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,680
And then, if it is bounded, look:

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,910
Is it even 1-safe?

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,955
If a Petri net is unbounded,
it is certainly not 1-safe.

00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:55,180
Because the fact that here values
greater than c are assumed,

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,300
contradicts of course the "maximum 1".

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,270
And this distinction "bounded/unbounded" can
be determined by the reachability graph.

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,590
Namely, a Petri net is unbounded exactly
when the reachability graph is infinite.

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,430
Or formulated differently:

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,350
A Petri net is bounded if and only
if the reachability graph is finite.

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:22,000
That is, while our example here was
not 1-safe, it is definitely bounded.

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,860
We can't see that here yet.

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,130
The Petri net itself is not so
relevant to boundedness/unboundedness.

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,560
But the reachability graph,
and that is finite.

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,965
We even see here what
the smallest constant c is.

00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:41,260
For the constant c = 3, it is true here that there
is never a node that has an entry greater than 3.

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,840
Of course, that would be true
here for c = 15 as well.

00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,850
But 3 is the interesting constant here.

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,650
Namely, it is the smallest
one that can be chosen.

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,870
For c = 2 this would not be true.

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,490
Then there is indeed a marking
containing a value greater than 2.

00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,360
And the graph is finite.

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:07,005
It could become infinite only if there
are also arbitrarily large entries.

00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,230
That is, if there
is no such bounding constant.

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:15,440
Any Petri net
with finite reachability graph

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,930
will have such a maximum constant
and then it is also bounded.

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,020
Any Petri net that is not bounded,

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,560
will automatically have an
infinite reachability graph.

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,380
And of course, we can then check
1-safety by doing syntactic checking on

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,720
the one hand.

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,400
So just looking at the Petri net

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,300
itself, and if that's already not satisfied,
then the Petri net is not 1-safe either.

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,760
If the first property is

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,510
satisfied, that no numbers greater than 1 are found
in the pre- and postweights, then the question is:

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,460
Is the Petri net then bounded?

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,520
Does it have a finite reachability graph?

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,440
If not, then it is not 1-safe either.

00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,550
And if it has a finite reachability
graph, then you can look at it

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,590
and see if the constant you can
choose to bound it is even 1.

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,170
Which would not have been
the case in this example.

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:17,590
Now we have seen examples
for different constellations.

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,710
We have seen bounded
but not 1-safe Petri nets.

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,630
Namely, what is just here.

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,110
And we have seen some 1-safe Petri nets.

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,910
What we haven't seen yet, which I
will discuss in a video, would be

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,200
an example of an unbounded Petri net.
