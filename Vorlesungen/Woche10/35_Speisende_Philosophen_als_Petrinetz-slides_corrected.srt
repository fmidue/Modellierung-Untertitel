00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:10,580
We are still in the Properties
of Petri Nets part of this lecture.

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,380
Overall, however, we are nearing the
end of the Petri net chapter.

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,930
In fact, we will not
be introducing any more properties.

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,750
But in this video I want to
discuss an example, which was at the beginning

00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,640
of the Petri net chapter, and which I
promised that we will look at later as a

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,720
Petri net.

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,890
That was the
so-called dining philosophers.

00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:46,440
At the beginning of this example I
had also mentioned some properties which one

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,110
would like to know and
investigate of such a dynamical system.

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,260
We have formalized some of them in
the meantime and can now apply them to

00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,260
this example.

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,190
There were questions about the progress or dead
ends in which a system can end up.

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,580
Or whether individual actions, which we modeled as
transitions in a Petri net, can always occur

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,900
at least once or can even
be executed any number of times.

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,750
There were questions about fairness, which in
the case of philosophers was whether two

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,680
philosophers together could
starve the third.

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,610
There were questions about causalities, whether certain
actions are mutually dependent (which can be

00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,159
found again here with the example).

00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,700
And also the last introduced
notions about concurrency and conflicts can

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,170
be related to this example.

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:42,909
Questions about bounds or
capacities, i.e. boundedness or 1-safety,

00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:47,600
which were also discussed last week,
have less application specifically to this

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,670
example.

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,420
We will look at those
separately again in a different context.

00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,700
But as a reminder,
let's start with this example.

00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,830
So what was it all about?

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,560
There were these three philosophers
sitting around a round table.

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,760
And, of course, this is not
a Petri net that you see here.

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,800
This is simply a sketch,
a representation of the situation.

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,810
There are these three
philosophers P1, P2, P3.

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,939
They sit around a round table.

00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:17,209
And always between two philosophers there is
a fork (English: Fork, therefore F1, F2,

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:18,280
F3).

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,969
And then the description of the situation
stated that the philosophers get hungry from time

00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,590
to time (we will
call that H_i for "hungry").

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,779
And then they would like to eat (this
will be labeled here E1, E2, E3 for the

00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,879
three philosophers).

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,310
And for that they
need both adjacent forks.

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,680
That is, if philosopher 1 wants to
eat, he needs forks 3 and 1.

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,709
And the procedure is that a philosopher
who is hungry picks up both forks at

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,769
any time, first the right one and only
when the right one is in hand, then

00:02:54,769 --> 00:03:00,890
also the left one if possible
(if the left fork is still there).

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,359
Then they eat with both forks.

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:06,669
And afterwards the philosopher puts the two
forks back on the table at the

00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:12,059
same time, so that then maybe someone
else could grab one of these two forks.

00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:18,180
So that was the verbal description
of the problem, now enriched by these

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:26,319
labels (I don't think that showed up
on the previous slide for this example).

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,069
Now we can try to model
this in principle as a Petri net.

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:37,809
And for that, I'm going to use exactly the
labels that have already appeared here in the Petri

00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:38,809
net.

00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:44,189
And these will be exactly
the places in the Petri net.

00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:47,129
The philosophers themselves will not.

00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:52,749
They will not appear in the Petri
net themselves, but they are essentially marked

00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:57,069
by their being hungry and eating.

00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,019
How could this Petri net look like?

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,969
I simply give this, on the one hand.

00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,650
On the other hand, I will now
explain how the philosophers find themselves here.

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,159
At first glance, one
cannot recognize them here.

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:19,320
So, there are the places H, W,
F each numbered with 1, 2, 3.

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,100
And the meaning for example
of the place H1 shall be:

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,140
Philosopher 1 is hungry
or is ready to eat.

00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,410
It will be that in
principle philosophers are always hungry.

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,650
It will not be modeled extra
that they have to get hungry first.

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,751
The point is that at any
moment a philosopher could decide to want

00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:43,650
to eat (that is, be ready to eat),
and then try to reach for the forks

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,910
(to be able to eat).

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,750
Since we know that there is this moment
where a philosopher who has already grabbed one fork

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,020
has to wait for the other fork,
there are the additional places W1, W2, W3.

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,340
They didn't appear like
that in the description.

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,320
This would be the state after the
right fork has already been picked up and,

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,110
if necessary, the left fork must be waited
for because it is not on the table.

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,290
For this purpose, a token
will be used at W1 or

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,290
W2 or W3.

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,950
To express that the corresponding philosopher
is waiting for the left fork.

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,130
Which also means that he
has already grabbed the right fork.

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,030
If a fork is not grasped,
then it is on the table.

00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,290
This would correspond to the situation as it is
here, where the forks are really still on the

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,290
table.

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,050
And for that, a respective token
will be used on F1, F2, F3.

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:46,180
So we'll see that here in
the three places, so to speak.

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:53,080
And then there will be tokens on the
E1, E2, E3 spots when the corresponding philosopher

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
is eating.

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,510
So, we don't see
the philosophers explicitly here.

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,380
But, of course, we can
still find them in here.

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:14,570
And that is, philosopher 1, for example, would ultimately
be represented here by this part of the Petri

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,310
net.

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:22,460
So the three places on being hungry, on
waiting, and on eating, which relate to philosopher

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:31,990
1, and ultimately this
transition before the waiting place.

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,710
This is also a transition that belongs to
philosopher 1, because this is where philosopher 1 first

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,090
becomes active (namely, when he is
hungry and finds a suitable fork, his

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,830
right fork, on the table).

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,640
For philosopher 1, F3 is the right fork.

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,730
This would start the
action for philosopher 1.

00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:02,180
Basically, this is philosopher 1, and accordingly
philosopher 2 can be found here in

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,900
the Petri net,
and similarly philosopher 3.

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,490
Then there are the two forks.

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,830
They're really separate
from the philosophers.

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,210
They're just there, and they're
also initially assigned a token.

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,700
And there's this transition.

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,220
We could actually have those
count towards philosopher 1 as well.

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:29,090
That would be the transition where philosopher
1 is done eating and releases the

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,090
forks.

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:36,490
So we find the three philosophers
again, expressed by this set of places.

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,580
The initial situation is that the three forks
are on the table (that's what we see here),

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,070
and that all three philosophers
are in principle ready to eat.

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,610
So they would be ready to reach for
forks in order to be able to eat then.

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,750
How are all these connections justified?

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,980
For example, we see here that in
fact this action, which would result in

00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,870
philosopher 1 waiting for the left
fork, depends on philosopher 1 actually being

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:11,870
hungry before and having already
taken the right fork from F3.

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:17,710
This would justify why these
are exactly the preconditions for this

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,380
transition that leads to then
philosopher 1 waiting for this fork.

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,260
Then we can look at:

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,210
What has to happen
for philosopher 1 to eat?

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,810
He must have grabbed
the right fork beforehand.

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,570
That is, philosopher 1 must have entered
this waiting state, and

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,269
then he must be able to grasp the
left fork (which is fork F1 for philosopher 1).

00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:43,459
So if this and this condition
are met, then philosopher 1 can eat.

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:47,079
Then there would be a token here
for philosopher 1, and then philosopher 1, when

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,569
he's done eating, would be
able to fire this transition.

00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:52,422
And that would cause philosopher 1 to
go back to the state where he's

00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:57,430
ready to eat, so again waiting for
the next time where he would eat.

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,569
And of course both forks, the left fork
and the right fork, would have to be

00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:01,620
returned by philosopher 1.

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,199
That's why there are these
two exit arrows from the transition.

00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:11,420
And for Philosopher 2 and Philosopher 3,
that's just symmetrically repeated in each case.

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:21,870
So the other parts in this section
do the same thing for philosopher 3.

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,940
So much for the kind of modeling here.

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:31,949
Then we can look at a
run, looking for properties that we've

00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:33,480
already seen.

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,730
Do we recognize concurrency?

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,839
Do we recognize conflict?

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,670
Can we say something about liveness?

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:44,269
Let's assume that philosopher 1 is
the one who becomes active first.

00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:48,009
So, for example, philosopher
P1 would like to eat.

00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:50,769
What would that mean?

00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:57,230
It would mean P1 has to see that
he gets the first fork in his hand.

00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,550
Of course, ultimately, philosopher 2 and
philosopher 3 also want to eat.

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:06,130
But let's assume that philosopher 1 will be
activated first and will also be able to successfully

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,550
fire this transition, because at the moment there is
the fork on the table that he needs for this.

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,740
So the first activated transition could
be that and the first executed action

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,029
could be that this transition will fire.

00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,279
Namely based on these two tokens.

00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:26,309
Of course, analogously, and concurrently to that,
philosopher 2 could also become active here

00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:30,500
or philosopher 3
could become active here.

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:39,910
So here now this, this and
this transition would be activated concurrently.

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,759
There is no conflict in
the Petri net at the moment.

00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,040
At least not
between these three transitions.

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,699
That's the only way I can say that, we'll have to
look at the rest to see if there are conflicts of

00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:56,750
any other kind.

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,490
So then P1 has now taken the right fork.

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,529
That's why this token here has also disappeared,
and it's also no longer recorded that philosopher

00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:08,040
1 wants to eat.

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,160
Because he is, so to speak,
in the process of getting the food.

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,329
At least to have already grabbed the right
fork, in order to possibly be able to grab

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,250
the left fork afterwards and to eat.

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,740
Let's assume that neither philosopher 2 nor
philosopher 3 get in the way somehow, and

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,970
philosopher 1 can continue to act.

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,290
Then, of course, he could now
fire this transition, which would ensure that

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,199
he also takes the
other fork (his left fork).

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:34,959
Because now this
transition would be activated.

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,310
It was not before.

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,779
It was not activated.

00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:38,779
Why not?

00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:39,779
Because there was no token here.

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:48,149
That is, this is a case of causality
here, because in fact this transition has to

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,730
fire before this
transition can ever fire.

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,869
That would be a necessary condition.

00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,619
This transition would be
a necessary condition for this.

00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:57,850
And we also find this
analogously in the other philosophers.

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,550
What we also have
now is a conflict situation.

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:08,089
In the step before,
that was not the case.

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,680
There the three transitions were actually activated
concurrently, and there were also no other

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,620
activated transitions than this one,
this one and this one.

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,730
There one can convince oneself that all other
transitions are not activated, because in each case at

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,759
least one precondition
place is not occupied.

00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,860
But now after executing the first
transition and then activating these transitions, it

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,670
turns out that there is a conflict.

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,690
There is another transition, which
is now also activated or still

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:43,999
activated, but now is in
conflict with another transition here, namely

00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:46,009
this transition.

00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:51,069
This transition is also activated, because
it finds a token in both of

00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:52,589
its precondition places.

00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:58,339
But it overlaps in its preconditions in
a conflictual way with the now here

00:12:58,339 --> 00:12:59,749
also activated transition.

00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:05,240
For both this transition and this
marked transition would like to consume this

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
token.

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,449
And since there is only one token there,
they cannot do that simultaneously, in parallel, concurrently.

00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:15,470
Both, so both this Transition and this
Transition are activated, but they are not activated

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,470
concurrently.

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,369
So they're in conflict, precisely with respect
to this fork 1, because that's the

00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:26,980
left fork for philosopher 1 and
the right fork for philosopher 2.

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:35,160
Let's assume that of the
two conflicting transitions, only the

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,470
one assigned to philosopher 1 fires.

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,829
Then this would ensure that
now the token is here.

00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:46,010
P1 has now also taken
the left fork and can eat.

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:53,069
F1 is empty, because Fork 1, the left
fork of philosopher 1, is taken from the table.

00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:58,220
And now this place is marked
here, where philosopher 1 is eating.

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:07,110
And after that, philosopher 1 could
or should put the forks back.

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,410
In parallel, philosopher 3 could have reached
for the fork here, while philosopher 2

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,600
could have done nothing at all
(because this place is not occupied here).

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,800
Now, for example, philosopher 1 would
fire the transition that ends his eating

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
process.

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,949
And this is to make sure that
here, here, and here lie tokens again.

00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:28,949
And indeed:

00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:37,610
After putting back the forks F3 and F1 by
philosopher 1, we are back to the initial situation.

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:46,529
This worked well because only P1
was active and not somehow P2, P3

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:47,740
interfered.

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:55,649
What other properties could we observe?

00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:01,269
Perhaps, for example, if P1, P2, P3
had not been so cooperative and had not

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,510
simply let P1 do it.

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,070
For example, are there
also possibilities of deadlock here?

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,439
We already know intuitively
that this is the case.

00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:13,569
Because we had discussed at the beginning
that actually P1, P2, P3 could behave unfavorably,

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:19,029
and thus the system could ultimately
end up in a dead state.

00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,379
How could that happen?

00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:26,410
For example, if at the beginning, when
here these three transitions were activated concurrently,

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,570
the philosophers also just
greedily execute each this transition.

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,489
So they reach for their right fork.

00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:41,020
These three concurrently activated transitions could
fire all three in any

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
order.

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,739
This is shown here
as happening in parallel.

00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:50,949
In reality it happens in any
order that this, this and this transition

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:51,949
fire.

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:56,679
Then we would be in this situation, where just
now all three philosophers are waiting for their left

00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:06,869
fork in each case, but will
never get the opportunity to actually

00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,350
be able to progress accordingly.

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,029
Now all of them have
taken their respective right fork.

00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:19,239
And none of them has the slightest
chance to reach for the left fork.

00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:24,889
But it will also never happen that
one of the three now releases his grabbed

00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,110
right fork.

00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,000
For this, for example, P1
would have to fire this transition.

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,899
For this, this transition would
have to have fired before.

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,949
But it can't, because
there is no token here.

00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:38,410
And it can't get there either,
because the same is true for P2.

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:45,490
P2 can put back the right fork
only after the left fork could be grabbed,

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,989
but it can't do this, because
this would require this token here, etc.

00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:54,299
Then we have indeed
reached a deadlock here.

00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:59,299
This also tells us that the
model is certainly not strongly live.

00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:00,410
One might still ask:

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,290
Is it at least weakly live?

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,980
The answer would be yes, because we have
seen that P1 can fire through for all its

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,260
transitions.

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,430
And P2, P3 could as well.

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,210
So at least each transition
is possible to execute once.

00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,040
Not in every pass.

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,820
But from the initial marking every
transition is in principle also executable at least once

00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,839
by suitable choices
of sequences and steps.

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,420
Boundedness is also present here.

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,440
I didn't try all cases
(we didn't build a reachability graph

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,900
and didn't explore all situations),
but it's easy to think that

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,800
this model is even 1-safe.

00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:46,810
Because at the beginning there was at most one
token per place, there are also no arrows with

00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,440
any weights > 1, so these
syntactic properties for 1-safety are already fulfilled.

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,390
And if you run the model, you
will also find that there is never more

00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,690
than one token on any place.

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,909
Thus the model is 1-safe
and of course also bounded.
