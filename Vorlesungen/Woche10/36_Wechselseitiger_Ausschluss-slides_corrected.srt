00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,560
Coming to the end of the Petri net

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,480
chapter, I would like to talk
through one or two examples with you.

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,400
These are examples which once

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,620
again illustrate typical
scenarios or modeling patterns.

00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,260
By "modeling patterns" I don't
mean anything formal like the

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,670
formally defined properties we have seen.

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,240
But simply certain approaches, how
one can handle typical situations

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,350
in dynamic systems
with Petri net modeling.

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,670
Some of this we've already seen.

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,400
In particular, this short video is
going to be about mutual exclusion.

00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,990
And you've basically already seen that in the water gate example
in the practice exercises (actually, this will happen on the ninth sheet).

00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,690
There were also some modeling
patterns in the afternoon example.

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,050
What I had discussed in the lecture and had
developed in the pipe tool as a Petri net.

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,930
For example, sources and
sinks were used: Transitions that

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,430
have no pre- or post-weight places.

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,290
Or we saw self-loops with a specific purpose,

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,660
namely to guard
certain places or transitions.

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,130
So, guard places, with which you can make

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,600
sure that certain transitions are
only fireable under certain conditions.

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,280
You could just look back at that example.

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,180
Or, for example, the capacity
bounds, that is, attempts to express

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,040
with Petri nets that certain places must not
contain more than a certain number of tokens.

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,090
Not because the Petri net
is bounded as a formal

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,790
property, but because it is
already brought in during modeling that

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,210
certain places must not contain more
than a certain number of tokens.

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,060
This is per se not given
when creating the Petri net, such restrictions.

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,710
This last aspect, constraining
capacity or the ability to

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,557
specify bounds, we're not going
to look at in this video.

00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,340
This will be about mutual exclusion.

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,940
In that sense, this is the second
to last video of the Petri net chapter.

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,160
The other will then be the
last video of the Petri net chapter.

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,270
Let's first deal with the
concept of mutual exclusion, in

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:25,480
English "mutual exclusion", therefore called mutex
(the place we use for it).

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,690
The scenario here is
as follows, and this could

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,750
be very generally
applicable in various situations.

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,470
We somehow consider at least two
actors (in this case exactly two

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,110
actors), each having a critical region.

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,870
This somehow means an execution region,

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:47,290
an action region, which they
each want to enter exclusively.

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,300
In this sense, it is
"critical" because

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,490
not both actors should be in
the critical region at the same time.

00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:58,540
So it must be prevented that the actors
enter their respective regions at the same time.

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,080
Because they could obstruct
each other there or

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,840
an undesirable behavior
could be the consequence.

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,460
So let's imagine that the two actors
are programs working on the hard disk.

00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,300
The critical region could be writing to
a certain file, and we don't want both

00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,050
actors to try to write to
the same file at the same time.

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,310
Therefore, there should always be at
most one actor in this critical region.

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,710
How can we think of
this as a Petri net design?

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,710
We might have two Petri nets,
for one actor and for the other.

00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,570
I have stylized the system quite simply:

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,790
We simply imagine one
actor represented by this Petri

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,970
net and the second actor
represented by this Petri net.

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,500
In reality, there could be
larger Petri nets behind each.

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,650
So it could be that what is here
only one place, is in reality a whole

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,580
Petri net, in which something goes in, something
comes out (and what happens in here doesn't matter).

00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,110
It doesn't have to be exactly one place.

00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,660
That would be the non-critical region.

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,750
So somehow a Petri
net part, where any actions

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,270
can be executed, which have nothing
to do with the critical region.

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,150
The same is true for actor 2.

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,290
So that's non-critical region

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,770
1 and non-critical region
2 for the two actors.

00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,060
And then there's also a
critical region for each actor, and

00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,580
let that be K1, K2 for those two actors.

00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,420
And the idea is to prevent both actors from

00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,590
being in this region at the same time.

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,280
So it should be prevented that

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,630
at the same time, for example, a
token is here and a token is here.

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,250
Because that would mean that both actor 1
and actor 2 are in their critical region.

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,040
So if we consider these actions k1, k2,
nk1, nk2 as "actor 1 enters its critical

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,980
region", "actor 2 enters its
critical region" and analogously for

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,670
leaving the critical region and
entering the non-critical region, then certain

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:51,130
sequences of actions should not be
possible for the common overall system.

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:57,370
So it should not be possible: k1, k2,
i.e. actor 1 enters the critical region, and before

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,600
actor 1 has left the critical region,
actor 2 also enters its critical region.

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,540
Because if that then meant
that both actors were trying

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,450
to write to a file, they could
accidentally do so at the same time.

00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,010
And of course the water gate example
from the exercise is quite similar.

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,540
That is about ships that are not supposed to be
in a certain part of the water gate at the same time.

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,490
That ultimately has to do
with critical region as well.

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,210
How could this be solved?

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,550
The Petri net, as stylized here,
of course has the property that it

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,850
would be quite possible to execute k1
and k2 directly one after the other.

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,260
Can we prevent this?

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,350
One can use a kind of guard place.

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,560
That is, an additional place which itself has no
functionality in the sense of actors 1 and 2.

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,570
But it ensures that certain
undesired behavior does not occur.

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,940
It is possible to synchronize via an
extra place, which is called a mutex place.

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,750
This is an auxiliary place, which is
often called mutex because of "mutual exclusion".

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,050
And what is the procedure here?

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,990
This is a place with
a token at the beginning.

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,460
And this token is always needed

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,100
when one of the two
actors enters its critical region.

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,640
So, for example, if actor 1
wants to enter his critical region, then,

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,520
of course, somehow the
non-critical region has to be

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:19,210
left, but in addition, this mutex
place has to be occupied with a

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,650
token, which actor 1 then consumes
in order to enter his critical region.

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,260
That is, to enter the
critical region (i.e., to bring the

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,290
token from here to here),
this token must additionally be consumed.

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,730
Which also means that then, for
example, directly afterwards the second actor

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,800
cannot enter its critical region.

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,480
Because that would mean executing k2, but
that also depends on this mutex place.

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,150
Let's assume that k1 fires.

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,370
Then this and this token
would disappear, here would be a

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,670
token, actor 1 would work
through his critical region and would

00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,720
not release the token for the
mutex until the critical region is left.

00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,070
So when actor 1 crosses
back over into the non-critical region,

00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,150
that is, leaves its critical region.

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,630
Then this token would be returned and

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,270
could be reused by k1 or by k2.

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,740
Intuitively, this synchronization across this
common place ensures that both

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,070
actors cannot be in the
critical region at the same time.

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,550
This is, of course, based on
the fact that there is a conflict.

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,230
The respective transitions k1 and
k2 here are both activated in

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,580
the situation shown, but
just not activated concurrently.

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,730
But we have a conflict
exactly over this place here.

00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,860
This prevents them both
from entering their critical region.

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,960
That would be the
informal and intuitive reasoning.

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,020
Of course, you can look
at this again formally by

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,130
just inspecting the reachability graph.

00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:04,140
We want to show that there is never a
token in places K1 and K2 at the same time.

00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,890
How can we show this?

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,230
We can plot the reachability graph.

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,070
I just did that without
developing that step by step.

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,080
So we see here, if
we take the place order NK1,

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:25,380
K1, K2, NK2 (so basically the way the
places were plotted here from left to right),

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,680
then we know
the start marking is (1,0,1,0,1).

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,510
We can see that here.

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,200
And then, in each case, it is

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,750
drawn which transitions are executable and what
the markings reached by them look like.

00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,660
We can actually see here, for one thing, that
there are no sequences of the kind k1, k2.

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,470
If k1 was executed, then before
k2 can be executed, nk1 must

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,680
be executed at least once more.

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,300
That is one observation.

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,250
And the other observation is indeed
that among all the reachable markings,

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,570
there is none where both
K1 and K2 contain a 1.

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,740
Here, respectively, the two interesting places
K1, K2 are marked in bold.

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,260
And there is simply no reachable marking where
there is a 1 here and here respectively.

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,740
The mutex place has
successfully achieved that here.

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,490
That would be the
simplest example for mutual exclusion.

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,168
And as I said, it shows up
in many examples and applications of Petri nets.

00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:29,520
One might also ask:

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,380
Where would this have
helped us in the past?

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,680
And well, actually also in the example
before in the context of the Dining

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,800
Philosophers one can make
use of mutual exclusion.

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,440
At least one can see this very

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,650
easily if one simplifies the
problem and considers only two philosophers.

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,920
In general, one could also
look for solutions for larger constellations

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,690
of dining philosophers,
following such synchronization ideas.

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,020
I discuss this now
only for the simplest case.

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,210
We look at the Dining Philosophers.

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,390
We just did that recently, so
I don't need to discuss that further.

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,820
We'll look at the simplification

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,570
that we sent one
of the three philosophers home.

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,678
So there are only
two dining philosophers left.

00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:14,870
We see that down here as well.

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,960
So philosopher 3 is
gone and it's one less

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,910
fork (otherwise the problem
wouldn't be as interesting).

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,860
But we now have P1,
P2 and the intervening F1, F2.

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,120
Now you could have them sit down
a little differently, facing each other, etc.

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,420
But that doesn't change the problem.

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,130
The problem is that

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,050
there are still deadlocks
in the simplified Petri net.

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,060
That is, even here it can happen that

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,180
P1, P2 starve because they
behave in an unfavorable way.

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,380
By both grabbing the right fork and
then not being able to eat, nor

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,710
being able to put the forks back because
they have to grab the left fork first.

00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:02,990
Also here in this Petri
net a deadlock is still possible.

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,300
So maybe synchronization
could help us there.

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,390
So we can try to introduce an extra mutex

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:17,180
place that somehow prevents, for example,
P1 and P2 from both grabbing exactly

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,670
one fork and then not being
able to get the second fork.

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,330
Maybe with a twist,
you can actually solve the

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,911
problem here at the application level, so
to speak, without an extra mutex place.

00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:34,580
Namely if one makes
the mental leap to say:

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,120
How would it be, then, if
the two philosophers changed their behavior slightly?

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,280
Namely, one could make one of
them a left-handed person, that is,

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,160
prescribe a change of handedness.

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,830
What would that look like?

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,000
Here I made P1
a left-handed person right away.

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,610
That is, P1's behavior would no longer be

00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,310
to grab the right fork first
and then wait for the left.

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,340
But to grab the left fork first
and then wait for the right one.

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,350
This is expressed here in the
Petri net by simply bending two arrows.

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:13,280
In each case the arrows, where philosopher
1 accesses the forks 1 and 2.

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,850
They were bent exactly in such a
way that the arrow, which led before

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,700
from F2 to something at the philosopher 1,
now instead comes from where F1 was before.

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,020
So exactly these two
arrows now run crosswise.

00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,860
Now I claim that this solves the problem.

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,880
Why?

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,460
This leads to the fact that now
not both reach first for the right fork,

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,340
but P1 for the left and P2 for the right.

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,140
That is, this fork F1 would now be
the one grabbed first for both of them.

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,860
And that ultimately makes it
a synchronization point or mutex place.

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,740
How can we convince ourselves of this?

00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,870
We could diagram the Petri net again in
a different way to make it more obvious.

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,570
Now this is a little asymmetrical
because I removed the third philosopher.

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,880
We can represent exactly
the same Petri net by

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,280
shaking it a bit
and rearranging the nodes.

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,940
Now, you'll either have to believe me or
compare it on the slides side by side,

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,210
that this is the same Petri
net as this one (just painted differently).

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,710
So exactly the same connections.

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:34,210
And here it becomes now more obvious
that the F1-place acts like a mutex.

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,110
This Petri net, as it is
shown here, is free of deadlock.

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:44,560
You can take my word for that, or
play it out, or plot the reachability graph.

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,510
The point is that here both P1 and P2,

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,220
to be filled, must each
fire this or that transition.

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,470
And they both access F1.

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,630
That is, if, for example, philosopher 1
reaches for his left fork (for F1),

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,650
then this very token
would disappear up here.

00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,780
And then philosopher 2 is practically
paralyzed and can only become active again

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:17,080
when philosopher 1 has put down
this fork again, i.e. has eaten.

00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,130
This is a conflict of course.

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,720
That is, these two transitions are in
conflict with respect to the fork F1.

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,080
This was just not the
case in the original philosopher problem.

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,620
There, at the beginning, the actions
of reaching for the right fork were

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,120
concurrent for all three philosophers.

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,650
Which sounds nice at
first, since it is parallel.

00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,940
But that led to a deadlock,
while here by this introduction of the

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,780
conflict, the mutual exclusion,
this mutex-place, it is finally

00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,040
ensured that not simply both philosophers
reach wildly for the first fork.

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:55,990
But only one of them can do that,
and afterwards the other one cannot do anything immediately.

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,910
But when philosopher 1 has finished eating,
philosopher 2 can take his turn again.

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,690
That is, here we
prevent deadlock by synchronization, by

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,380
using this mutex place ultimately.

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:16,630
This is a very typical
modeling pattern in various applications.
