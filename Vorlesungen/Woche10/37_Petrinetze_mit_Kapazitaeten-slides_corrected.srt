00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,530
In the last video, we
briefly discussed typical modeling patterns

00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,280
in Petri nets, some of which
we had already seen in examples,

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,310
but which we
explicitly addressed again there.

00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:21,750
One of them was
the mutual exclusion or synchronization.

00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,900
We also discussed this with
the example of the dining philosophers.

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,810
How you can avoid the problems with
two philosophers that you have with three philosophers.

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,390
Another requirement that one often has in
practical modeling with Petri nets is that

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,530
one wants to say
something about the capacity of

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,160
individual places or, in
particular, to limit the capacity.

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,240
What is meant by this?

00:00:51,240 --> 00:01:00,960
For example, you want to make sure that no
matter how the Petri net fires, there can never

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,190
be more than a certain number of tokens on
each of the individual places, and you also want to

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,990
be able to specify different such
upper capacity bounds for different places.

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,700
This is not exactly the same
as the boundedness of Petri nets.

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,950
Because that was a property that a
Petri net may or may not have.

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,280
You have a Petri net and you make a
statement about all the markings that can be reached.

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,830
That, for example, a certain maximum number
of tokens per place is never exceeded.

00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,500
That would be something that comes up.

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,130
One has a Petri net
and it results for this Petri

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,840
net that never more tokens
can accumulate on a place.

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,790
That is something different than saying:

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,680
You want to express in modeling

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,348
that, for example, a particular place
never holds more than five tokens.

00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:55,170
Even if it could happen
during normal firing of the Petri

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,270
net that six tokens accumulate on the place there,
one would like to express in the model that

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,570
then no firing at all
may take place in that case.

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,080
While the question
of boundedness/unboundedness assumes:

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,000
One fires according to the definition
of Petri nets and then observes whether

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,020
many tokens can accumulate
on a place or not.

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,470
Suppose instead we want to
constrain that in the model.

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:25,790
So for example, if we describe
a snack vending machine,

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,250
we might want to express that
there would never be more than

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:35,240
20 items of a given snack type in stock.

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,490
Or if we think back to the
afternoon modeling (which I had gone through

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:50,300
as an example), there was this Playstation place
where a reservoir of tokens could accumulate, how

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,450
many times after that the
action "play" could then be performed.

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,700
And you might have
wanted to somehow express that

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:04,160
there are never more than seven tokens
on that place at any one time.

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,520
That if this is the case,
it is not allowed to continue firing.

00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,290
This is the kind of restriction one
might want to impose on one's Petri nets.

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,060
How might one go about doing that?

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,250
One has to consider:
How can I model this?

00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,280
And one way out would be to simply say:

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,660
One makes that explicit.

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,960
You sort of introduce a
new kind of Petri net.

00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,220
We'll do that for a moment.

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,660
That doesn't have to scare

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,210
you because it's a very simple
definition, also has very clear semantics.

00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,650
You could say you just extend
the notion of Petri nets and introduce

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,840
so-called "Petri nets with capacities".

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,790
How could one do that?

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,710
One would have to
express this extra information.

00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:49,430
One would want to take a normal
Petri net and add capacities to that.

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,410
By which is meant that if S is the set of

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,400
places, you simply specify another
natural number for each place.

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,850
One can do this in a capacity function,

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,500
a mapping from the place
set into the natural numbers.

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,720
This is to express that never
(not in the initial marking, but

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,220
also never later) there can be more tokens
on a place than k specifies for this place.

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:33,130
Thus in particular for the initial marking m0 it
must be true that less than or equal to k.

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,850
Less-equal in which sense?

00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,090
In the sense in which
we can compare such functions.

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,570
This is a marking in the same sense
as the initial marking is a marking, and

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,520
as the pre- and post-weighting functions
in the Petri net were markings.

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,750
And for such functions,
which we called markings,

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,050
we had introduced a comparison.

00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,350
And as a reminder, very
importantly, that was the place-by-place comparison.

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,610
That was not simply:

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,900
How many total tokens are in m0
and how many total tokens are in

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,470
the capacity function when you
evaluate it for all the places?

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,020
But it was
about the place-by-place comparison.

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,440
So for each place it must hold that m0
of d is less than-equal to k of s.

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,750
Which means exactly
that the initial marking

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,810
on no place carries more
tokens than the capacity function allows.

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,130
And we would include this
capacity function as a modeler.

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:36,100
Of course, it's not particularly interesting here
if k returns zero for a place.

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,890
So we would expect there
to always be positive numbers here.

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,940
Formally, one could also allow k
to be zero for a given s.

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,490
But this would mean that you never

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,460
want to have any tokens on this place.

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,850
Then one does not need
to introduce this place at all.

00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,920
So it would not make sense.

00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:03,220
Interestingly, the pipe tool that we've been
working with (that I've been working with,

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,210
and maybe you have too, in
practice) knows about such Petri nets.

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,300
It knows the notion
of "Petri nets with capacities".

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,200
I had not used that there, but
there you can write capacities at the places.

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,030
And then this fulfills exactly the
intuition, which I had already mentioned.

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:28,420
So each place s may
contain at most k(s) tokens, ever.

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,440
This is very important:

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,810
So this must hold not
only for the initial marking,

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,270
but also when the
Petri net evolves and fires,

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,700
it will be ensured that there are never
more than k(s) tokens on the place s.

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,780
If there were, then a firing
operation would simply not be performed.

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,870
How do we represent
this in the graphical representation?

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,890
This is just the mathematical notation.

00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,700
There we will simply write
these capacities next to the places.

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,860
So far, we have written numbers
in the Petri net only at the

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,590
connections, at the arrows from places to transitions
and from transitions to places, with which we

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,210
have expressed the weight there,
from the precondition and postcondition function.

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,380
Now we will also allow numbers
to be attached to the places.

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,740
Namely exactly the numbers which
should correspond to the capacity.

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,290
How could this look
like, such an example network?

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,400
For example like this: a normal
Petri net, as you have seen it

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,128
many times before; but now there is
the annotation 2 at the place s1.

00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:49,420
So at place s1, 2 would be annotated, at
place s2, 1 would be annotated, and that would

00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:55,300
correspond (in terms of the previous slide) to this
function mapping s1 to 2 and s2 to 1.

00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,610
Very importantly:

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,540
These annotations are now at these
places and not at the arrows.

00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,430
There could still be such numbers there.

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,990
They then have the
same meaning as before, namely

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,660
describing the pre- and post-weight
of transitions with respect to single places.

00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,450
And in addition there can be these numerical labels
at the places, or for a Petri net with

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,640
capacities, there must even be at each
place such a number written on it.

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,210
What is the idea here?

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,890
Why do we do this in the example?

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,160
We would want to achieve with
it that on this place never more

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,500
than two tokens lie and on
this place never more than one token.

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,930
That is, certain firing

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,920
operations that would be possible if you
ignore the capacities should not be allowed now.

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,030
If we look at this Petri
net and forget the two annotations

00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,740
here, we could easily consider that

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,250
all three transitions are
enabled in this initial state.

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,673
Because t1 can fire because
there is a token here.

00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:55,430
And t2 can fire because there is a token here.
Also t3 can fire because there is a token here.

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,130
However, if we take the capacities into

00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,420
account, we would have to conclude:

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,010
No, t1 cannot fire after all.

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,180
Up to now it was important for the
firing of t1 that all preconditions are fulfilled,

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,690
i.e. that there is a token
here (because there is this input arrow).

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,770
Now with these capacities it
would have to be checked additionally

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,090
that the transition has also the
opportunity to deposit its output tokens.

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,180
And here this would
mean: consume a token from

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,290
here, which is also present, all good,
but also deposit a token in s2.

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,240
And that would not be allowed in
the constellation shown here, because there is

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,280
already a token here and it says
here that there may only be one token.

00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:40,280
This means that the firing of t1, which is
actually possible in this situation, would suddenly not be allowed.

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,040
On the other hand, t3
would be allowed to fire.

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,030
It would consume this token and
has no problem to deposit anything,

00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,920
because there are no output arrows.

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,920
And also t2 is allowed to fire, because
t2 finds a token in the precondition place and

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,320
is allowed to put a token
in the only postcondition place of t2.

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,470
Because there is already one
token, but there may be two.

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,010
So here t2 may fire, but not t1.

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,870
And t3 may also fire.

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,810
That would be the
definition, which simply corresponds to

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,870
what is required here
for this one firing operation.

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,620
Of course, this has
to be expressed formally.

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,360
So the semantics would
have to be adapted.

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,790
But that is also done quickly.

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,480
Let's remember, previously it
was said that a

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,000
transition is activated in a certain
marking m, in this case for m0.

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:40,320
So far it was only required that the
marking corresponding to the preweight function of the

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,050
transition is less than or
equal to the current marking.

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,030
Because this would mean in the end
that per place the transitions do not request

00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,380
more tokens than are present in
the current situation, per place-wise comparison.

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,250
And here comes now the expression for
the fact that we must look evenly

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,360
also at the issuing points, whether there
is so to speak still enough place.

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,860
What does that mean?

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,450
We look at what happens
when this condition is met.

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,950
Then I could say in principle
with normal firing in a Petri net:

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:20,940
We just subtract from the current marking
the pre-weights for the current transition we want

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,670
to fire, and add (again,
in places, with these two operations

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:34,470
we introduced in an earlier video) the
place specifications for this concrete transition, that

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,000
is, in each case how many
tokens should be put in the places.

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,390
And then we see if what
comes out (what would come out

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,760
in normal firing) is still
less-than-equal to the capacity marking.

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,950
And only if this is so (that's
why it says "and if it is allowed"),

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,220
the tradition t in the
marking m may fire at all.

00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,670
Before, only this
first condition was required.

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,680
Now the second
condition is additionally required.

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
And if this is also fulfilled,
the transition is allowed to fire.

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,670
What happens then?

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,970
Then what is written here
is simply the new marking.

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,040
This was also the
case with normal firing.

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,890
When firing a normal Petri
net, this had to be fulfilled.

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,710
Now it is additionally required that the
new marking that would come out is

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,780
less-than-equal to the capacity function.

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,990
And only then the transition is allowed to
fire and of course leads exactly to this marking.

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,040
Here it is enforced that
always at all reachable markings

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,870
the capacity function is
not exceeded at any place.

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,730
This is written here again.

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,110
So there it is ensured
exactly that the transitions fire only

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,560
if they would not break the capacities.

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,420
That's exactly what would happen here.

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:55,150
So if we were to fire t1 here,
then the capacitance would be exceeded at this point.

00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,040
So this firing is simply forbidden.

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,260
What would that mean
for the reachability graph?

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,690
It will be smaller, more
restricted compared to the reachability

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,680
graph that would result
if we ignore these capacities.

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,660
So here would be the
accessibility graph for this concrete example.

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,780
There, ultimately, you can see exactly:

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,940
In the initial marking, t2 and
t3 are fireable, but t1 is not.

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,340
So in the initial marking that we see
here, (1,1) is exactly this input node (the initial

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,390
node in the reachability graph),
there t1 is not activated.

00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:44,320
Although, if we were to ignore these
two annotations here, t1 may well fire.

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,830
So t2 can fire, t3 can fire.

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:55,000
What comes out is exactly the same as
what would come out in a normal Petri net.

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,600
Only, when we look at
which further transitions are possible,

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,920
we always check which transitions are

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,940
activated, taking into
account these capacity bounds.

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:14,590
Here it has an effect above all
here that we may not fire t1 here.

00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,630
If, on the other hand, we have fired

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,100
t3, which leads to the marking (1,0),
then this token would have disappeared here.

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,110
Then we are also allowed to fire t1.

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,700
That's why the t1 transition is possible here,
because it puts the token from here to

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,510
there and that's allowed, because even after
that there's still only one token here.

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,720
Not like here, where if
we had also fired t1, there

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,440
would have been two tokens on
the second position (which is not allowed).

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,870
The other transitions are all
allowed as they are here,

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,600
and also result from the definition.

00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,950
Here, we would have effectively simply
prevented certain firing events by this

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,970
specification, and therefore restricted
the reachability graph to this

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,400
behavior (and not had another
transition for example here with t1).

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,810
You can do it that way.

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,520
Then one would just have to
handle this new kind of Petri nets.

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,730
As I said, the tool
we saw can already do that.

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,570
However, we would then have
to start adapting all our terms.

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,340
We would now have to transfer our mathematical
terms (the properties we have been looking at)

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,180
from the normal, simple Petri nets
to these "Petri nets with capacities".

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,010
Maybe we don't want to do that.

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,480
Maybe we would like to continue
working with the simple Petri nets we

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,830
have come to know so far.

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,470
And interestingly, one can do just that.

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:50,600
There is a way to accomplish what
we have done here without doing these

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,480
annotations in any Petri net
that works with such capacity bounds.

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,880
Instead, create an equivalent Petri
net that gets by with

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,630
simple means (so
doesn't need such annotation),

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:12,050
but still achieves the behavior that
is enforced here by the capacities.

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:20,420
So in particular, in the end also for
these rewritten Petri nets here in the example

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:26,150
such a reachability graph should come out and
just about t1 should not be fireable from

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,520
this initial state (which would be possible
if we would simply ignore the annotations).

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,630
We do not want to ignore the annotations.

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,730
We just want to
deal with them differently.

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:44,420
So the insight here is that
you can also achieve this kind of

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,570
capacity bound without immediately introducing
a new Petri net type.

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,280
And that is by
applying a modeling pattern.

00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,830
Namely, you rewrite what you want to have
with the means of a simple Petri net.

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,800
It's a bit of a trick, so to

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,890
speak, that you use in modeling,
but here you do it systematically.

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,710
What is the idea?

00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,730
How do we go about it?

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:16,670
Well, the basic idea is that
we express, so to speak, this

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:22,670
capacity (the fact that there can be no
more than a certain number of tokens on

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,560
each of the places) by introducing
an extra additional place for each place.

00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,295
A so-called complement place, on which
we create a reservoir, so to speak.

00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:38,180
In this reservoir, we always keep a
record of the maximum number of tokens that

00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,240
may be put on the original place s.

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,820
So in the example just
now we had two places.

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,210
For each place we
add a so-called complement place.

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,800
Simply a place that has a new name,

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,090
but where we can still tell
which original place it belongs to.

00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,550
We can do that by
using the same place name and

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:05,090
just putting an overline over
it like that, a bar.

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,610
That becomes a normal Petri net again,

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,240
where we don't give
any annotations for the capacities.

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,650
So we have to encode that information differently, and
for example, yes, we have to specify an initial

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,370
marking for our new complement
places (so we say what the

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,390
initial marking for those complement
places contains in terms of values).

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,810
And that's where we see
that the capacity function comes in.

00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:33,260
Namely, we're just going to put exactly
as many tokens on the complement places as

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:41,330
would be allowed according to the capacity, but
are not actually already present in the initial marking.

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:48,520
So if the capacity would say, on
place s five tokens may lie, in the

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,500
initial marking of the Petri net however
on this place s only three tokens lie,

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,620
then we would put in the initial marking 5
- 3 = 2 tokens on the complement place.

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,640
So m0 of s-bar would
then be k(s) - m0(s).

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:14,800
This ensures that, at least initially, the sum
of the tokens in the place itself and in

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,010
its complement place gives
exactly the desired capacity that

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,760
we would have written to the
place in the Petri net with capacities.

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,190
In this way, we can make sure that
this is the case for the initial marking.

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,370
And in what follows, we'll
make sure that it's an invariant.

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,290
So that this is
preserved for every firing operation.

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:39,400
This idea here, which first of all originally
ensures that the complement places are occupied, we

00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:47,740
will then guarantee that and maintain it
throughout the lifetime of the Petri net.

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,250
And that's why we can then always make

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,550
sure that there are actually never
more than k(s) tokens on the place.

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:04,390
Because, so to speak, we will only allow more
tokens to be put on the place if there

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,530
are still a corresponding number of
reserve tokens in the complement place.

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:14,910
How can we achieve this?

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:22,680
We have to make sure that
when firing transitions, this invariant is preserved.

00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,580
That is, we probably need to
introduce more weights into the Petri net.

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,470
Just now we added places.

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,680
If we just added those, they
would be isolated nodes in the

00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,900
Petri net and there would
be no input or output arrows.

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,020
Then, of course, they wouldn't affect
the behavior of the Petri net.

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,775
So we still need to
attach them to the Petri net.

00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:45,960
How do we do that?

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,730
That always depends on what a
particular transition does to a particular place.

00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,980
So let's look at
a transition and a place.

00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,200
Here we describe how to do that

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,780
for a combination of
a transition and a place.

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,660
And of course we do that
for every transition and every place,

00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,790
for all combinations
of transition and place.

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,430
When we focus on a transition
and a place, we can ask:

00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,000
What is this transition
doing with this place?

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,520
Does it take tokens from it?

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,470
Does it deposit tokens in it?

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,100
Or is it neutral, so to
speak, with respect to this place?

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,150
It could be that t and
s have nothing to do with each

00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,880
other, that firing t can simply never
change the number of tokens in place s.

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,800
How can this be determined?

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,960
Ultimately, you have to
look at this difference.

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,338
So one looks at what the
post-weight function of transition t says

00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,200
for place s and what the pre-weight
function of transition t says for place s.

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,520
That expresses how many tokens the transition
t would put in the place s.

00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,360
And that expresses how many tokens transition
t would take out of place s.

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,320
And since there's actually allowed to be
both a forward and a backward arrow,

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,870
so to speak, for a transition and a
place, those could also both be positive values.

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,070
We're looking at the net behavior,
so to speak, the difference of that.

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,380
That's where a number comes out.

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,810
It could be negative, it could
be zero, it could be positive.

00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,240
If it's negative, then it means that

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,940
the transition is taking tokens
out of the place overall.

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,870
This could be, for example, if the post
weight is zero and the pre weight is three.

00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:26,910
Then it means that the transition takes three
tokens from the place and gives none to it.

00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,710
So in total it takes out three tokens.

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,625
It could also be that it
takes four tokens and puts two away.

00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,430
Then it would take a
net total of two tokens.

00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:44,340
So whenever this difference for the certain
t and the certain s is negative,

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:53,790
we add an edge of t to
the complement of s, with weight -n.

00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,290
Why?

00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,370
This is a negative number here.

00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,210
We negate that one.

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,180
And the corresponding positive
number that comes out,

00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,950
we write it as a weight to an
edge from the transition t to the complement place.

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,750
Because the idea should be:

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:12,150
Transition t somehow takes a certain
number of tokens from the place s,

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,050
maybe two; then these two tokens
should not disappear, but they should

00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,790
be deposited in the complement place.

00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,860
They fill up the reservoir, so to speak,

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:26,490
from which later firing operations are likely
to place tokens on place s again.

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,770
For example transition t, but
in particular also other transitions,

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,600
which might want to
deposit something in s.

00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,500
They should and will be able to do this

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,070
only if there are enough
tokens in the complement place s-bar.

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,280
And the same number of tokens must also

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,840
be deposited in s-bar when
tokens are removed from s.

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,826
That is, if the transition t
removes tokens from the place s altogether.

00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:02,850
What about the reverse case?

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,990
That is, when the transition t
net puts something into the place s.

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:12,990
That is, if the post-weight function for t
with respect to s is greater than the pre-weight

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,760
function of t with respect to s,
that is, if this difference is exactly positive.

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,730
Then transition t would like to put a
certain number n of tokens into place s.

00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,770
We may only allow this if
there are not yet so many

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:36,630
tokens there that this addition
of tokens exceeds the allowed capacity.

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,380
How can we guarantee this?

00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:43,120
By ensuring that there
is a pre-weight edge from

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,350
s-bar to t with exactly
this number n as weight.

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:53,200
Then t should only fire if it
finds a corresponding number of tokens in s-bar.

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,440
And this will be the case
exactly (because of this invariant here),

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:07,390
if indeed the sum then
is not greater than k(s).

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:19,420
The sum of the tokens currently
lying in s plus this number n.

00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:27,070
These three steps,
these three ideas/applications ensure

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,560
that the desired behavior occurs.

00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,230
If you look even more closely here,
you can see that it seems a

00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,960
bit strange that the case "equal
to zero" is not considered at all.

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,630
It only says what we
do when this difference is

00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,840
negative, and what we do
when this difference is positive.

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,090
What do we do if the difference is zero?

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,590
Then we don't do anything.

00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,520
Why not?

00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:55,180
That would be a combination of
transition t and place s, so

00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,490
that t takes as many tokens out
of s as it puts in there.

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,190
This could either mean that t has
nothing to do with s at all.

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,990
So if these two values are both
zero, then there is no reason to

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,440
somehow introduce additional conditions.

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,910
Because then t has nothing
to do with s at all.

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,610
Or it could mean that there is indeed

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:21,160
such a loop, where t both takes
tokens from s and puts them there.

00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,720
And even with the same value.

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,550
But then nothing changes in
the balance, so to speak.

00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:32,530
It doesn't change whether
the capacity is kept.

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,550
If t takes two tokens
from s and deposits two tokens

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,660
there, then this cannot lead
to the capacity bound being exceeded.

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,270
This is because t then
does nothing to s on net.

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:49,300
Then we do not need to introduce another
condition or another edge into the Petri net.

00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,550
Therefore, one does not need
to consider the case additionally.

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:55,450
One only has to deal with
these cases, which are covered here.

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,940
What is achieved by this?

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:07,930
What I had motivated as an idea
then remains as a guarantee, so to speak.

00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:16,300
So not only for the start marking m0, but
according to the construction from the previous slide, it

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:22,630
holds for every reachable marking that
m(s) plus m(s-bar) is exactly k(s).

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,100
This is exactly what we want
to achieve; and achieve with the construction.

00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,500
That's the invariant, the
idea that was here.

00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:41,710
And the fact that we
insert additional edges between transitions and

00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:47,410
complement places ensures that a transition
t is fireable only if the capacities

00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,470
in its postcondition places
are not yet exhausted.

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:59,650
Because we only allow t to be
fired if there are ultimately enough remaining capacities.

00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,900
And this is checked/query/guaranteed
by the complement places.

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:13,960
Especially in the case where t puts something
into a place, this is only allowed if a

00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,830
corresponding number of tokens can
be taken from the complement place.

00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,470
If not, then t would not be able to fire.

00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,460
And this is not because of any
change in the semantics of Petri nets,

00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,530
but simply because of
these added transition dependencies.

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,830
Transitions are not added.

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,735
Places are added, but also
new conditions on the transitions.

00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:41,590
We do not prove now that this works.

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,406
You can take my word for it
or try it out on many examples.

00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:47,920
You can also think about
why this works in general.

00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,840
The fact is, it works.

00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,887
Let's do this with an example.

00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:59,020
In practice, of course, you
are supposed to do this yourself.

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,010
So let's take a look at
the Petri net we had here.

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,360
Namely, that was the Petri net.

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,010
If we just look at the black part.

00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,890
There was not yet the red
part in this Petri net, and here

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,840
there was a 2 on it and here there
was a 1 on it, as these additional annotations.

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,870
They must not exist
in a normal Petri net.

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,430
So they have disappeared here now.

00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:23,320
But instead, the complement places were
introduced on the one hand, and

00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,720
additional arrows on the other hand.

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,160
And how is it done here?

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,350
There is the complement place to
s1, and it contains a token.

00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,680
Why?

00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,240
Because s1 should contain two tokens, but
in the initial marking it contains only one.

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,200
So this "reserve token" is
put in the complement place.

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,250
In s2, on the other
hand, there is one token in

00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,440
the initial marking, and there may
only ever be one token there.

00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,160
Therefore, there are no reserve
tokens in the complement place.

00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,050
This explains why s1-bar and s2-bar
look exactly the same and carry

00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:04,480
tokens accordingly (or s2-bar just
does not carry any tokens).

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,520
And what about the transitions?

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,730
We look at every combination of s and t.

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,620
So, for example, s1 and t1.

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:18,512
The s1 loses a net token to t1.

00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:21,430
This is because t1 takes exactly one
token from s1 and puts nothing there.

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:33,660
Therefore, according to the construction from here, t1 must
deposit a token in the complement place to s1.

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,960
Because t1 takes a token from here from
s1, t1 must deposit a token in s1-bar.

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,970
That is why there is this arrow.

00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:48,990
That doesn't mean that t1 doesn't
continue to deposit a token in s2.

00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,870
So this existing black
output that leaves t1 remains.

00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,390
It simply adds an output.

00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:02,965
Namely, when t1 takes a token from
s1, it deposits a token in s1-bar.

00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:10,710
Then, after this firing, this would
mean (if it were possible, because there

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,400
would still be space here; which is not
the case at the moment) that then a token

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,570
would move from s1 to s2, but
also a token would be put in s1-bar.

00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:24,120
And this is now explained in the
same way for each of these arrows.

00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,050
Now let's look at t1 and s2.

00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,670
There we see that t1 net
puts a token in s2, because

00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,760
t1 doesn't take anything out
of s2, but puts something there.

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,500
So t1 adds a net token to s2.

00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,610
Therefore, t1 must take
a token from s2-bar.

00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,960
This justifies and
forces this arrow here.

00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,940
For t2 and s1, as well
as s2, it is quite analogous.

00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:00,510
So t2 places a token in s1,
therefore must take a token from s1-bar.

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,750
And t2 takes a token from s2,

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,400
therefore must put a token
in s2-bar (that's this arrow).

00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,980
Then we still have t3 to consider.

00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,830
The t3 and s1 have
nothing to do with each other.

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,460
There is neither an input nor
an output arrow between t3 and s1.

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,940
Therefore, there is no connection between
t3 and the complement of s1.

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,330
This is exactly a possible
case, which corresponds here to the

00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,680
case that n = 0 and
would be just neither negative nor positive.

00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:40,650
This explains why there is
no connection between t3 and s1-bar.

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,170
However, t3 and s2 are relevant.

00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:50,540
Because t3 takes a token from s2,
it must therefore deposit a token in s2-bar.

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,800
Between the two places and
three transitions there are six combinations.

00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,830
The s1-t3 combination
leads to no additional

00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:09,410
connection, the other five each lead to an
arrow (exactly the five red arrows we see).

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,810
And what have we achieved?

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,740
I already briefly flashed
the reachability graph just now.

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,720
Here it is in its entirety.

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,290
First, we see that it looks exactly
the same (except now, of course, for the

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:36,860
indication of the complement places; apart
from that) as the reachability graph we

00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,200
saw here, which, however, depended on
our looking at this particular semantics.

00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,450
Where we take extra care, for example, if
we want to fire t1 from this marking,

00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:54,170
that we leave that alone if it would
make the number of tokens in s2 too large.

00:33:54,170 --> 00:34:05,750
That's exactly what we don't
have to consider explicitly here somehow.

00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,040
But if we consider the quite
normal semantics of firing Petri nets, it

00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:16,640
is also automatically ensured here in the
starting marking (which is that by adding

00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,580
these two complement
places and their respective

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,030
entries) that in this
marking t1 is not fireable.

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,060
For what would have to be
for t1 to be allowed to fire?

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,490
It would have to be able
to take a token from s1.

00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,440
Of course it can, because
there is a token there.

00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,710
But it would also have to be
able to take a token from s2-bar.

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,910
And that is exactly what it cannot do.

00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:45,290
Because s2-bar is this position here,
and there is no token there.

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,300
That means, there is no more reserve

00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,130
which would somehow allow
to put something on s2.

00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:57,630
So here, t1 would be effectively
prevented from firing in this marking.

00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:02,160
Simply by, in that case, this connection.

00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:09,090
In the same way, the
other connections each allow firing.

00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:14,760
So, for example, t2 may
be fired in this start marking.

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:27,180
Also, looking at the same example with
the other semantics, t2 was allowed here

00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:34,530
because it didn't somehow violate the
capacitance on any of the places.

00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:40,590
And that is automatically given
here, because t2 can fire.

00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,530
The t2 would like to put a token in s1.

00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,400
It checks whether there is any
potential for this, i.e. it checks

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,790
whether there is a token in s1-bar.

00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,360
This is the case here.

00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,100
There is still a token
here precisely because the total

00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,210
capacity allowed for s1 was
not exhausted with this 1.

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,010
This is represented by this 1.

00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,490
And therefore the firing of t2
is possible and leads to the

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:11,220
fact that afterwards two tokens lie on
s1 and no token anymore on s1-bar.

00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,420
So another placing of a token
in s1 would not be allowed.

00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,600
This would be prevented here (that
one puts further tokens on s1), because

00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,380
on s1-bar no more
reserve tokens lie at all.

00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,350
If we now
simply construct the reachability

00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:33,390
graph normally for this example shown here
on the left, this graph comes out.

00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:40,590
And except for this information for
the complement places, it is equivalent to

00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:45,960
the desired reachability graph, which
resulted with the specially built semantics.

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,200
So we have achieved our goal, even
without a new kind of Petri net.

00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,070
Simply by clever use
of the complement places.

00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,910
You can see this as
a trick, as a modeling

00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,160
pattern, or as a systematic construction

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,050
that generates a matching Petri net without
capacities for every Petri net with capacities.
