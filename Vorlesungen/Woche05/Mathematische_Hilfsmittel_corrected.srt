123 # slide
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Before we move away from
static modeling with UML next week

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,460
and move into Petri nets
and thus dynamic modeling, I would

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:23,370
like to first introduce,
or I hope repeat for

00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,020
most of you, some
mathematical tools/terms in this video.

00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,960
So that would be simple set theory

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,120
terms, specifically sets,
functions, and graphs.

00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,550
Hopefully this will really just be
a review for many of you, in

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:43,350
particular the Komedia students
will recognize the slides

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,800
as they are quite similar to
my Mathematical Structures lecture after all.

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,470
I think also for the computer science

00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,860
students some of the slides will
be quite similar to the logic lecture.

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,650
And also for the ISE students

00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,040
these terms should be known,
for example from Discrete Mathematics.

00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,500
Nevertheless, I repeat, simply so that
you also see the notation exactly

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,660
as I will have it in the further slides.

00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,340
Of course, if you find
that you already know all

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,090
of this, you may skip this video.

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,895
We're going to be dealing with sets.

00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:29,450
So sets will occur in
the formalization of Petri nets.

00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,940
And sets you know at least
from school as simply such collections of

00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,100
elements, written with braces.

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,910
If the sets can be enumerated, piece by

00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,520
piece, then it is
written down with commas.

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,190
And maybe dot, dot, dot,
if it's an infinite set

00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,460
that can be continued in a natural way.

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,790
Of course, there are also quantities that
cannot be written down in this way.

00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,590
For example, you can't write down
the real numbers in exactly this way.

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,530
What one also likes to
do is to indicate sets by

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,510
describing their properties, so to speak.

00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,670
So, for example, the
set of all natural numbers

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,280
that are even, one likes to
write in this so-called comprehension notation.

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,410
So the set of all n, "so that".

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,630
Then in this case there is a condition.

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,860
Let the n come from
the natural numbers and be even.

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,270
With N written in this way, we denote

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,900
the set of natural numbers
which also contains the zero.

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:37,190
In our specification of the vector operations,
or even before the vector operations in

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,700
the arithmetic operations, I had also
used this as a set briefly.

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,200
That would be again the representation for
some general property that depends on an x.

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,060
And if there is a basic set,
as it was the case here above, one

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,410
writes it gladly also in such a way
that one says already before the vertical line,

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,300
from which basic set the elements come,
which come into question for the set.

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,310
And then there is another property.

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,760
That was "being even" above,
that can be any property.

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,110
With it one means:

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,970
All elements from X, which
additionally satisfy the property E(x),

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,280
shall be gathered in the set M.

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,790
This simply as possibilities
to write down sets.

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:36,580
Important for consideration of sets is,
that sets are unordered, and also

00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:43,780
the number of elements, thus the
occurrence of an element, cannot be multiple.

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,450
First of all, sets are disordered,
so whether I write down \{1,2,3\}

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,680
or \{1,3,2\} or any other
permutation of the numbers 1,2,3.

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,000
It is always the same set.

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,150
Secondly, elements do not
appear more than once.

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,610
Or, if you would write them
down several times, it makes no difference.

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,390
The set \{1,2,3,4,4\} is
still just the set \{1,2,3,4\},

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,660
because it only matters if
an element is in the set:

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,170
Yes or No?

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,910
And not somehow how many times.

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,300
That means, these sets are equal,

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,510
but of course different from \{1,2,3\}
and also from the set \{1,2,3,4,5\}.

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,490
Because there is actually one element too
much or too little in each case.

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,100
While this "double occurrence" of 4 is
just no indication for somehow "too much".

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,810
The 4 is in the set.

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,960
So this distinguishes sets
from simply lists of elements.

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
Then there are
some notations and operations.

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,500
On the one hand relations.

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,880
On the one hand being contained.

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,770
So an element a is in
the set, if it occurs in it.

00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,790
And this element sign
is the abbreviation for it.

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:05,950
Then we need sometimes for counting
the number of elements in a set.

00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,830
Of course, this is only
possible if the set is finite.

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,800
Generally, sets can be
infinite, like the natural numbers.

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,860
But if this is a finite set,

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,260
we use this notation here
to denote that finite number.

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:26,500
Then there is the notion of
subset and a corresponding symbol for it.

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,430
That is, A is a subset of B.

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,720
Then every element from A
must also be contained in B.

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,960
This need not be true vice versa,
then the sets would even be equal.

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,560
But at least every element from
A must also be present in B.

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,400
So for example the even integer numbers
are a subset of all integer numbers.

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,030
That is, it works for infinite sets too.

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,730
And it's not the same as
saying that the subset relation says

00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,090
the sets are smaller in
the sense of "contain fewer elements".

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,670
It's really a matter of whether all the elements in A
are also in B, no matter how many there may be.

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,650
Then there is this particular set.

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,080
It would have the
number of elements zero.

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,750
That's why you like to write
it with some kind of zero,

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,260
but as a set zero with this crossbar.

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,530
Or just the curly
braces without anything in between.

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,410
So this is the
set that contains no elements.

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,580
It is automatically a subset, even
a real subset, of any other set.

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,590
Real subset in the sense that it is
not equal to any non-empty set, of course.

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:40,970
Then there are operations
which link several sets.

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,985
On the one hand there is
the set union, written with this symbol.

00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:50,600
We will see the reverse symbol
for the average in a moment.

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,530
The union is
about throwing quantities together.

00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,810
So the result set here is the set of all elements that occur
in A or in B. The result set cannot be smaller than this symbol.

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,400
The result set cannot be smaller
than either of the original sets.

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:17,930
And of course both A and B are
subsets of the union of A and B.

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:26,540
Then there is, so to speak, dual
to it, with the reverse symbol, the intersection.

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,580
That would be the set of all
elements that occur in A and in B.

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,290
So only the "or" in this
conditional has been replaced by "and".

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,730
But this makes a big difference.

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:44,480
In particular, the average usually makes
sets smaller, at least not larger.

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,870
So the average of A and B is
in any case subset of both A and B.

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,610
While here the reverse was true:

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,730
A and B are each subset of the union.

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,700
These are operations on sets in such
a way that the kind of elements

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:12,590
that are in the result set would be
elements from the original sets A and/or B.

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,650
Then there is another operation, the

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,590
so-called cross product
or "Cartesian product".

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,990
There the structure
of the elements changes.

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,025
So in the result set are other
kinds of elements than in the original set.

00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:30,341
Namely not simply the elements from A
and/or from B, but pairs of them.

00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:36,140
So we have given two sets A and
B, and we get the set of all pairs.

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,050
And ordered pairs in such a way,
that the first element, the left element

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:47,090
of the pair, always comes from the set A,
and the right element always comes from the set B.

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,320
Of course, the sets may
also be equal by chance.

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,770
But in the general case, these
are simply two sets A and B,

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,990
and the first element of the result pairs
always comes from A, the second from B.

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,270
For example, for a two-element
set and a three-element set,

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,640
the Cartesian product here
would be as follows:

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,110
That has six elements.

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,650
It results exactly the number of elements of
a cross product with finite sets A and B

00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:29,140
as the product of the numbers of
the elements of these two single sets.

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,680
Because we can pair every element from
this set with every element from that one.

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,540
There are exactly these
six pairs in the case.

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,770
Of course, the order in which we
write down the elements here doesn't matter.

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,890
So it is only about the fact that
these six pairs have to occur in the

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,590
result set, not in which
order we wrote them down here.

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:53,230
A special case would be the
Cartesian product with the empty set.

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,550
There always the empty set comes out.

00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,840
For example, no matter how large the
first set is, we cannot form pairs if

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,290
the second element, the
second component of the

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,830
pair, is to come from this
empty set (in which there is nothing).

00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:13,320
This is what I had just said:

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,120
For finite sets, the number of elements of
the cross product is equal to the number

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,940
product of the numbers
of the individual elements.

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:28,050
And you can also
think about certain relations

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,750
between the relations we have seen.

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:37,740
For example, in the case of subset relation and the cross product, if
A is a subset of B, then the same kind of relation holds

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,680
even after cross producting with some set C. And it
doesn't matter if I have the set C or not.

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,740
And it doesn't matter whether I multiply the set C by it from the right
when I do the cross product, or whether I multiply it by it from the left.

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,600
These are simply compatibility properties of the
cross product, in that case with the subset

00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,590
relation.

00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:03,990
The important thing is that
the reverse is not true.

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,260
Just because this subset relation holds

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:13,890
doesn't necessarily make this subset relation hold,
especially if C is the empty set.

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,910
That would be to form pairs.

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,470
And just as you can form pairs
and form a cross product between two sets,

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,380
you can extend that
for more than two sets.

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,290
Then you get
triples, quadruples, quintuples, etc.

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,140
So we'll have tuples at times in

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,070
the formalization that contain
more than two components.

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,830
And then the notation
is just quite analogous.

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,210
Then we write more than
two elements in such round brackets,

00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,820
separated with commas, the components.

00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:54,420
From n components we form
n-tuples and for n = 3,

00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,050
n = 4, n = 5
there are still special notations for them.

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,180
Of course, tuples are
not the same as sets.

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,050
So really important:

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,390
Take round brackets here
and not curly brackets,

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,970
because the components here
are relevant in their order.

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,800
So while the set \{1,2,3\} written
down and the set \{1,3,2\} written

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,680
down, each written in
curly brackets, were the same

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,790
thing (this showed up a few
slides ago), it's just different for triples.

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,240
So the triple (1,2,3) is
really different from the triple (1,3,2),

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,030
although the same elements appear.

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,610
But they appear in a different order.

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,500
So as elements of this
triple cross product (cross product

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,720
between three sets) these are different
values, and this is very important here.

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,430
It is also true that an element
can appear several times in the tuple.

00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,730
This is also different
from the situation with sets.

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,210
It's not that it doesn't matter
that the 4 is here twice.

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,010
These are really
different tuples, especially since

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:08,530
the one on the left is a quadruple
and the one on the right is a quintuple.

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,000
But also independent of that.

00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,030
If we were to write
4 and 4 here, for example,

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,520
that would also be significant,
that the 4 occurs twice.

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,600
Different from sets.

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,510
Then there's another
construction on sets that

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,850
we'll need, called the power set.

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:37,330
This starts from a single set, that is, not
two sets A and B, but a single set M.

00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,340
And the power set is the set A.

00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,380
And the power set is the
set that contains all subsets of M.

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,310
This is written with this calligraphic P.

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,950
So the power set of M
is a set consisting of sets,

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:59,380
and each contained set is
a subset from the original M.

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,830
It is called a power set
because the number of elements increases exponentially.

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:13,660
So approximately the power set of
the set \{1,2,3\} is this eight-element set.

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,990
The set that consists of eight
elements, each of which is a set.

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,220
That is exactly all subsets
that exist of \{1,2,3\}, including the

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,570
empty subset and the entire
set as a subset of itself.

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,780
Then we can play games and consider
what this means for the empty set.

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,430
Then we find that the power set of
the empty set is just not the empty

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,190
set, but a one-element set
containing exactly the empty set.

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,510
This will rather not fall on
our feet here in the lecture,

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,090
because we will not
necessarily start from empty sets.

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,770
But it is important for
understanding ultimately also this power set

00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,501
notion that it makes a difference whether I have the
empty set or the power set of the empty set.

00:14:56,501 --> 00:15:02,150
You can iterate that, and then
more such exotic sets come out.

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,830
But they're not absurd.

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,880
They simply follow from the
definition of the power set notion.

00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:16,310
For finite sets, which is what they are
now in all three cases, this relation holds:

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,190
The number of elements of the power set is 2 to
the power of the number of elements of the basic set.

00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,070
This is where the name power set comes
from, because this is a power of two.

00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:35,030
And from this you can
see that if you form

00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,420
power sets, for example in modeling
to capture states of a system,

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,950
there are then just
very quickly very many states.

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,860
That is one thing that one
would like to avoid, in modeling ultimately.

00:15:48,860 --> 00:16:00,680
To repeat this notation, or just
to see it in action in

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,490
an example, let's take a look at
what such a state modeling might look like.

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,780
This is not yet an example of what I
would actually like to model dynamically directly as well.

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,500
For now, I just want
to use the terms we've seen

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,190
to describe the state
space of a possible system.

00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,030
So let's say we want
to use a Petri net later

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,150
to model a snack machine, for example.

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,270
That contains two kinds of snacks,
namely bars and chips, and of

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:32,300
course it can store a supply of
each of those two kinds to begin with.

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,330
In fact, in our vending machine, it can

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,350
have a maximum of 30 pieces of
each of the two types in stock.

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,780
When you operate the vending machine,
you're dealing with a simple interface.

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,370
There is a yellow
and a red warning light.

00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:53,850
One warning light indicates that there
is no change left in the machine.

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,800
And the other warning light means
that no more bills are accepted.

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,710
They can light up
independently of each other.

00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,610
One could also consider

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:14,910
that there could be a
logical connection between these two conditions.

00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,090
But this should not be
assumed for the time being.

00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,290
They can light up
independently of each other:

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,490
Neither of them can light up, or

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,240
that the yellow one is on, or that the
red one is on, or that both are on.

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,830
What would be the set of
all possible states of this automaton?

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,750
What would you have to remember in

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,230
each case, what could be all the
possible manifestations in which the automaton can be?

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:39,120
One can distinguish the states according to
which lamps are on or not on.

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,060
You can distinguish how many bars are
there and how many chips are there.

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,250
If one would enumerate
that, one could say:

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,110
One writes a triple in each case.

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,530
In the first component, you
talk about which lights are on.

00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,163
In the second, for example,
how many bars are present.

00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,790
And in the third,
how many chips are present.

00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,530
That would be a triple cross product.

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:06,090
For these stock level indicators, you just
take a number between zero and 30.

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,310
Because those are the possible expressions, that you
have zero bars, two bars, up to 30 bars.

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:16,290
And what is the expression
for which lights are on?

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,190
That's a subset.

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,780
It can be that no lights are on at all, the
yellow one is on, the red one is on, both are on.

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,730
That is, in the
first component of our state

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,860
triples we would want to store
a subset of the set \{yellow, red\}.

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,290
So our state space, the
set of all possible states of

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:40,110
this automaton, could be viewed as the
Cartesian product of the power set of the

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,720
set \{yellow, red\} (which is
a set of two colors

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,880
simple) and in each of the other
two components a number between zero and 30.

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,230
So about the element (empty set, 20,

00:18:51,230 --> 00:19:00,260
10), which is undoubtedly an element of
this power set, would be interpreted like this:

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,490
This is the state in
which both warning lights are off

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:11,180
(because this is where the empty quantity is), and
there are still 20 bars and 10 packages of chips.

00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:23,960
If one had seen both lights switched
on at the same stock level, then

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,803
one would simply have the full quantity \{yellow, red\}
in the first component instead of the empty quantity, which

00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:36,950
is also a subset of this quantity, and
thus is an element of this power set.

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:41,720
Now one can also ask:

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,510
How many states are there?

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,170
Here are two.

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,490
How many are there altogether?

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,090
And there already the
state explosion would strike.

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,260
If one calculates by means of the
rules, which were further in front on the

00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,990
slides, how one calculates the number
of elements of such a constructed set.

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,390
Because of the cross product, you would
get the multiplication of the number of these

00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,510
elements, the number of these elements,
and the number of these elements.

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,650
And by the power set here, we have 2 to
the power of the number of elements in the inner set.

00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,460
And then you would get a total
of something in the neighborhood of 4000:

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,880
4 times "more than
30" times "more than 30".

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,250
That's getting close to 4000.

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,660
You don't want to just write
them all down as a graph.

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,180
And there we might have
to look for other ways,

00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,390
especially to deal with
such stocks or resources.

00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:37,040
That's where the high number
of possible triples comes from.

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,680
We will deal with that
later, how to model such things.

00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,230
This means not only to specify
the quantity, but also to express

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,130
state transitions in a compact way.

00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,750
What we still need is
the notion of function or mapping.

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,780
Functions are known from school.

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:09,680
So typical representatives, which one
uses in the analysis for example.

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,540
In the discussion of curves
we do something with functions.

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,050
But there is also the general notion of

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,450
function for arbitrary sets and
not necessarily sets of numbers.

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:23,150
So notation here:

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:28,280
The function has a name and maps
from a definition set to a value set.

00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,990
And these are just arbitrary sets:

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,500
Sets of numbers perhaps,
but conceivably also other sets.

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,030
For example, sets
that have occurred here.

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,950
So a pair of elements, which are related.

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,650
For one, a possible notation would be to

00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,186
say, if we apply f to a,
b comes out, so b is f(a).

00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:55,170
You know this from school, y
is f(x) for respective corresponding elements

00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,600
from definition and value domains.

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,590
We will write it
down partly like this, that

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:08,460
is, as an explicit mapping: a
is mapped to (or mapped to) b.

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,010
Then, if the set A is finite, one could

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:17,760
simply make this kind of
specification for all elements from A.

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
This would describe
the function completely.

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:26,250
Of course, that doesn't work for functions like
the sine function, where we have the set

00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,980
of all real numbers
here, to write down finitely.

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,710
But for many cases, especially when A
is finite, we can also describe a

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:39,060
function by finitely many such mappings.

00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,870
We can also use the same kind of

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:48,270
notation when we specify a general mapping
rule, i.e., how a maps to f(a).

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:55,530
For example, "a squared" could also be specified
this way instead of by this y=f(x) notation.

00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,790
Example:

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,700
The square function on the
set of integers, we would say

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,940
that is a mapping from
the integers to the natural numbers.

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,210
When we square, negative
numbers can't come out.

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,420
So even though you
can put negative numbers in

00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,040
here, because of the set Z of
integers, a natural number always comes out.

00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,370
One way to write down
the assignment rule is this equation:

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,660
f(z) is z squared.

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:30,870
Or just by this
written down with this mapping

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,590
symbol, this information
represented in this way.

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:41,530
A few concrete pairs here would be just such
mappings as -3 to 9, -2 to four, etc.

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,090
In the concrete case, of course,
this cannot be written down finitely by

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:51,700
enumeration, because there are still infinitely many
negative and infinitely many more positive numbers.

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,440
But if the range were finite,
one could give a section here

00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,740
and take that as a whole
as a description of the function.

00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,100
That was the notion of function.

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,980
And finally, we're going to use graphs.

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,250
Of course, intuitively, we've done
that up to this point.

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,040
We've already had graphs written down.

00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,620
Formally, a graph is
also simply a set-theoretic construct.

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,550
So you have a set of labels or labels.

00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:32,170
Then a directed and edge labeled graph (these
will be the graphs we will be primarily interested

00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:38,530
in) is given by a
node set and an edge set.

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,470
The edge set is a subset of the

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,340
cross product of the node set with
the label set and with the node set.

00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:53,500
That is, the edges will be triples in which
the first component is a node, the second component is

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,060
an element of the label set,
and the third component is another node.

00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,060
With the interpretation that
it's an edge labeled

00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,240
with that label from
the node to the node.

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,990
So now here are the sets, but
in the triple, these are concrete representatives:

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,530
a node, a label, a node.

00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,490
These abbreviations V and
E come from "vertices"

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,220
and "edges", the English
terms for nodes and edges.

00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,420
These sets are likely to be infinite.

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,370
We will often deal with finite graphs.

00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:32,950
But from the point of view of set theory, the
vertex and edge sets in particular can also be infinite.

00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,050
The label set is then
usually a finite set after all.

00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,000
It can also be very small.

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,120
We can also have a
label set with only one element.

00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,430
Then there is no real information in it.

00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,000
Then one would have formally always
this one element from the label set.

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,210
This corresponds basically
to an unlabeled graph.

00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:58,390
The being directed comes from the fact
that we have triples here and not sets.

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,580
So there's a first
component and a last component.

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,480
You can interpret that as
a directed connection from this

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,850
node standing in the first component to
the node standing in the last component.

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,350
What about empty sets?

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,085
I had already discussed infinity.

00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:26,900
What you can have is that the node set
is not empty, but the edge set is empty.

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,430
That would be a trivial graph where there
are only nodes and no edges between them.

00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:37,520
What cannot be is that the node set
is empty but the edge set is not.

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:48,560
If L is empty, there can be no
edges, because that set would necessarily be empty too.

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,350
We had the observation that some

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,900
set cross product with the empty
set is always the empty set.

00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:02,660
So the normal cases are already
that we are dealing with non-empty sets.

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,160
Another example:

00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:15,440
Let's just take as a set of nodes
the representatives for farmer, wolf, goat, cabbage head.

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,160
Following up on our example
very early in the lecture.

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:26,930
And as the set of labels, we use
the relationships that came up in the example.

00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:32,420
We had modeled static briefly, and there
we had talked about possession and feeding relationships.

00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:38,870
And for this node set, this label
set, that would be a conceivable edge set.

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,250
That's a set of triples, where in each case the
first component comes from V, the second component comes from

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,060
L, and the third component comes from V.
And then, of course, we can represent that.

00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:53,210
And of course, we can
also represent this pictorially as this

00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,990
graph, which we had already
seen earlier in the lecture.

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,850
There were not these letters F, W, Z, K,

00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:08,990
but here the respective pictures for
farmer, wolf, goat, cabbage head were inserted.

00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,880
We would then really have pictures,

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:22,170
be it with photos in there or these
nodes with the respective labels from the set V.

00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,940
But importantly:

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,520
This one up here is a graph.

00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,210
This one below is
represented as an image somehow.

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,450
But mathematically, what's up
here is already a graph.

00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,250
We don't have to translate this into
a picture to accept it as a graph.

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,720
It says up front here, a
graph is just such a pair of

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,300
vertex and edge sets with this context.

00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:57,330
So strictly speaking, these three
sets together are stated the graph.

00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,110
And this below is simply
an image of the graph.

00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:06,510
That's going to be relevant because we're just
going to represent Petri nets as graphs as well.

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,570
And then mathematically, it's not necessary to
paint that as a picture as well.

00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:18,180
Instead, this mathematical representation
alone is an exact representation.

00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:23,840
More about this in the next week,
when we will talk about Petri nets.
