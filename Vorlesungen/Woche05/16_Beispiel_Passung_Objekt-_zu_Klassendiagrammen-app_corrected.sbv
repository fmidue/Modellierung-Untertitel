0:00:02.200,0:00:07.450
So let's take a look at this task.

0:00:07.450,0:00:10.400
This is an old exercise.

0:00:10.400,0:00:14.650
You should also find
it in the task collection.

0:00:14.650,0:00:18.270
And this is a task like that:

0:00:18.270,0:00:25.780
We have class diagrams and object diagrams and
want to find out whether there is a fit in

0:00:25.780,0:00:27.110
each case.

0:00:27.110,0:00:31.120
This should happen in pairs for each of
the two class diagrams and each of the five

0:00:31.120,0:00:32.120
object diagrams.

0:00:32.120,0:00:33.210
To consider in each case:

0:00:33.210,0:00:36.140
Is this valid or not?

0:00:36.140,0:00:39.440
So does the object diagram
fit the class diagram or not?

0:00:39.440,0:00:42.660
We can go through that.

0:00:42.660,0:00:50.000
So let's look at the left class
diagram and the first object diagram.

0:00:50.000,0:00:52.610
What do we see there?

0:00:52.610,0:00:53.730
Specifically:

0:00:53.730,0:00:57.640
Does the object diagram
match the class diagram?

0:00:57.640,0:01:03.970
And one way to think about that is
always to go through the object diagram,

0:01:03.970,0:01:09.030
look at each object, and first look at
whether that object is justified in itself.

0:01:09.030,0:01:13.409
That is, whether it fits the class diagram in the
sense that the class of which it is supposed to be an

0:01:13.409,0:01:14.409
object exists at all.

0:01:14.409,0:01:17.810
You can see here, of course, that I
don't specify any attributes or methods.

0:01:17.810,0:01:23.159
So these are stylized classes and objects,
where it is only about the existence and

0:01:23.159,0:01:27.090
not about which properties are
additionally given by attributes.

0:01:27.090,0:01:32.600
So I would have to look now here only whether
A and C (thus the two classes in question

0:01:32.600,0:01:34.609
here) exist at all.

0:01:34.609,0:01:37.320
Yes, they do occur in the class diagram.

0:01:37.320,0:01:41.299
So this object "a" or the
object "c" could already exist.

0:01:41.299,0:01:48.969
And then we have to see, if
all relationships, which occur in the object diagram,

0:01:48.969,0:01:50.179
are justified by the class diagram.

0:01:50.179,0:01:51.179
And that none are missing.

0:01:51.179,0:01:56.899
So if we just take a look at the "c"
object, for example, and see what

0:01:56.899,0:02:05.029
relationships it has in the class
diagram, then it can have a relationship

0:02:05.029,0:02:08.990
to B objects in aggregation.

0:02:08.990,0:02:10.921
And now we can look:

0:02:10.921,0:02:12.519
No multiplicity is specified.

0:02:12.519,0:02:15.769
That is, the default multiplicity
is to be used there.

0:02:15.769,0:02:17.010
And this is "0..*".

0:02:17.010,0:02:22.019
This means that the "c" may have B
partners, but it does not have to.

0:02:22.019,0:02:24.091
And in the concrete case
here it does not have any.

0:02:24.091,0:02:25.091
The "c" has no B-partners.

0:02:25.091,0:02:29.970
But this is not further serious, because it is
not enforced.

0:02:29.970,0:02:33.969
So this aggregation does not somehow lead
to the fact that something is missing.

0:02:33.969,0:02:45.519
And the "c" has no other properties
or relationship requirements.

0:02:45.519,0:02:53.480
From C there is no other association, aggregation,
or composition somehow as a relation to other

0:02:53.480,0:02:54.480
classes.

0:02:54.480,0:03:02.030
And C doesn't inherit from anything either, so it
doesn't have any other requirements somehow that

0:03:02.030,0:03:03.879
it has to fulfill.

0:03:03.879,0:03:06.090
What about the "a" object?

0:03:06.090,0:03:13.200
That obviously belongs to this class A.

0:03:13.200,0:03:24.120
And there, of course, one can ask oneself, first
of all, whether all relationships that are supposed to

0:03:24.120,0:03:26.609
exist from A are really given here.

0:03:26.609,0:03:33.189
There is especially this relationship here,
but it has "0..*" as multiplicities.

0:03:33.189,0:03:37.590
That means, "a" could have a relation
with itself or, for example, with

0:03:37.590,0:03:38.750
another A-object.

0:03:38.750,0:03:41.930
But it doesn't have to, because of this "0..*".

0:03:41.930,0:03:45.709
So for "a" and "c"
at least nothing is missing.

0:03:45.709,0:03:48.739
But what about this relation, which
is there in the object diagram?

0:03:48.739,0:03:50.080
It must be justified by something.

0:03:50.080,0:03:53.840
It is not enough to say that "c" and "a" are not
missing anything (so everything that "c" and "a" should

0:03:53.840,0:03:54.840
have, they have).

0:03:54.840,0:03:58.709
There must also be no relationship in the object
diagram that is not even provided for in the class

0:03:58.709,0:03:59.709
diagram.

0:03:59.709,0:04:03.380
And if we look:

0:04:03.380,0:04:09.620
There is no basis in the class diagram
for "c" to have a connection to "a" (that

0:04:09.620,0:04:12.629
is, a C object could have a
connection to an A object).

0:04:12.629,0:04:15.230
There is inheritance here, for example.

0:04:15.230,0:04:19.760
But that does not ensure that
C has any connection to A.

0:04:19.760,0:04:23.680
It says that B inherits from
A, not that A inherits from B.

0:04:23.680,0:04:29.730
Yes, if A inherited from B (if the inheritance arrow
were reversed here), then A would inherit from B

0:04:29.730,0:04:31.970
the relationship to C as well.

0:04:31.970,0:04:36.250
Then this link in the object
diagram would be quite justifiable.

0:04:36.250,0:04:40.000
But as the class diagram 1
looks, this is not so.

0:04:40.000,0:04:41.580
So here the answer would have to be:

0:04:41.580,0:04:42.620
It doesn't fit.

0:04:42.620,0:04:46.980
So (a) doesn't fit the first class diagram, because
this relationship between "a" and "c" from the

0:04:46.980,0:04:50.530
object diagram is not provided
in the class diagram at all.

0:04:50.530,0:04:55.130
Now we can ask ourselves:

0:04:55.130,0:04:57.890
What would it be like if we had
looked at the other class diagram?

0:04:57.890,0:05:00.410
And there, the answer is indeed:

0:05:00.410,0:05:01.570
Yes, that fits.

0:05:01.570,0:05:03.570
I'll just abbreviate that.

0:05:03.570,0:05:06.510
I have already talked about
this inheritance arrow.

0:05:06.510,0:05:10.130
That it goes in the wrong direction, so to
speak (for "a" to be able to have a relationship

0:05:10.130,0:05:11.130
with "c").

0:05:11.130,0:05:12.860
Here the arrow is
exactly the other way round.

0:05:12.860,0:05:17.000
That is, there is admittedly no obvious
relationship between A and C in the class diagram.

0:05:17.000,0:05:22.670
But A inherits from B, and thus inherits not
only the attributes and methods, but also all

0:05:22.670,0:05:25.230
other relationships that B
has with any other classes.

0:05:25.230,0:05:30.370
So in particular, A also inherits
from B this relationship to C.

0:05:30.370,0:05:33.690
And that's why this
link is justified here.

0:05:33.690,0:05:35.800
And if we look at:

0:05:35.800,0:05:37.220
Are the multiplicities correct?

0:05:37.220,0:05:38.220
Yes.

0:05:38.220,0:05:43.400
"c", for example (it says so here),
must have a relation to at least

0:05:43.400,0:05:47.140
one B. That doesn't seem
to be the case at first.

0:05:47.140,0:05:49.820
Because here there are
no B-objects at all.

0:05:49.820,0:05:54.130
But every A-object is also a
B-object because of this inheritance.

0:05:54.130,0:05:56.940
This "A inherits from B" means:

0:05:56.940,0:05:59.080
Every A-object is also a B-object.

0:05:59.080,0:06:05.440
That means the requirement that "c"
must be related to a B-object is

0:06:05.440,0:06:07.680
fulfilled by this link here.

0:06:07.680,0:06:13.960
Because the "a", which is an A-object, is
also a B-object because of inheritance.

0:06:13.960,0:06:20.510
And any other requirements that
would be violated here do not exist.

0:06:20.510,0:06:26.890
For example, "a" does not have to have a relationship
to an A-object since, although nothing is written here,

0:06:26.890,0:06:31.750
but then implicitly "0..*" is
written there as multiplicity.

0:06:31.750,0:06:38.300
So this self-relation on the class level, from
A to A, does not necessarily have to be present

0:06:38.300,0:06:40.140
in an object diagram.

0:06:40.140,0:06:47.320
Because it is also possible that the lower
limit zero of the multiplicity is used

0:06:47.320,0:06:48.640
as incidence.

0:06:48.640,0:06:54.370
Okay, so that would explain (a)
for both the first and second class

0:06:54.370,0:06:55.370
diagrams.

0:06:55.370,0:07:00.490
Let's look at (b), again
for the first class diagram.

0:07:00.490,0:07:05.670
And look at whether all the relationships
that are here are justified.

0:07:05.670,0:07:07.770
And also whether none are missing.

0:07:07.770,0:07:08.770
So here:

0:07:08.770,0:07:11.640
Is there a relationship
between a B and a C object?

0:07:11.640,0:07:12.880
Yes, that fits.

0:07:12.880,0:07:16.330
That would correspond to this
aggregation in the class diagram.

0:07:16.330,0:07:19.700
There is the relationship
between a B and a D object.

0:07:19.700,0:07:20.910
And that fits as well.

0:07:20.910,0:07:24.740
That corresponds to this
relationship in the class diagram.

0:07:24.740,0:07:26.800
Okay, is there perhaps something
that might be missing?

0:07:26.800,0:07:27.830
So how is it with B objects?

0:07:27.830,0:07:31.670
Do they still need to
have any other relationships?

0:07:31.670,0:07:34.310
So there's aggregation to
C; that's satisfied anyway.

0:07:34.310,0:07:41.490
And it might be zero anyway because there
are no multiplicities explicitly on it.

0:07:41.490,0:07:45.350
The same is true for this relation to D.

0:07:45.350,0:07:52.110
And the fact that B inherits from A does
not necessarily lead to further links.

0:07:52.110,0:07:58.330
Because A does have this relation to A, but
just with these lower limits of zero in each case.

0:07:58.330,0:08:02.740
So nothing follows from this that would
be somehow missing in the object diagram.

0:08:02.740,0:08:05.210
What about "c"?

0:08:05.210,0:08:07.510
No further requirements
are added for it.

0:08:07.510,0:08:09.020
So "c" can have relations with Bs.

0:08:09.020,0:08:10.840
In the concrete case, it is
even so in the object diagram.

0:08:10.840,0:08:14.250
But no multiplicities are specified either.

0:08:14.250,0:08:20.170
That means zero would be allowed
as the count by default anyway.

0:08:20.170,0:08:21.830
And what about the "d"?

0:08:21.830,0:08:23.770
There is indeed a requirement.

0:08:23.770,0:08:28.610
Namely this requirement here that each
D-object must be related to exactly

0:08:28.610,0:08:29.610
one B-object.

0:08:29.610,0:08:30.610
But that is the case here.

0:08:30.610,0:08:32.329
So it also fits.

0:08:32.329,0:08:37.130
Therefore (b) actually fits
to the first class diagram.

0:08:37.130,0:08:40.719
What about the second class diagram?

0:08:40.719,0:08:51.990
The fact that the inheritance arrow is now
reversed does not change anything in this specific

0:08:51.990,0:08:53.190
case.

0:08:53.190,0:09:03.190
This would simply mean that A could
also be here but does not have to be.

0:09:03.190,0:09:07.590
We can also actually look at a B-object
concretely, so not an A-object,

0:09:07.590,0:09:11.020
which is automatically also a B-object.

0:09:11.020,0:09:15.490
And the other
requirements are also fulfilled.

0:09:15.490,0:09:22.840
So in particular, "b" is related
to at most one D to satisfy this.

0:09:22.840,0:09:27.330
And the C object is related to
at least one B object, so it also

0:09:27.330,0:09:30.670
satisfies this multiplicity here.

0:09:30.670,0:09:38.140
And the existing links here are
also covered by the class diagram.

0:09:38.140,0:09:50.500
So actually (b) fits both the
first and second class diagrams.

0:09:50.500,0:10:01.730
What about (c)?

0:10:01.730,0:10:07.060
Does that match the first class diagram?

0:10:07.060,0:10:10.460
We'll have to take a look at that:

0:10:10.460,0:10:19.520
Now we have an A-object here, so the
question arises, to what extent this

0:10:19.520,0:10:20.990
changes something.

0:10:20.990,0:10:29.510
Just now we had this relationship
between "b" and "c" as a link.

0:10:29.510,0:10:31.330
That can't be the case here anymore.

0:10:31.330,0:10:33.510
Now there is an A here.

0:10:33.510,0:10:39.270
So this can only be a
manifestation of this relationship.

0:10:39.270,0:10:40.270
Let's see:

0:10:40.270,0:10:44.880
Does this justify that "b"
has a link navigable to "a"?

0:10:44.880,0:10:48.690
The "b", any B, is also an A.

0:10:48.690,0:10:57.980
And since As have such relations to
As, "b" may also have such relations.

0:10:57.980,0:11:06.660
So a B object (since it is also an A object)
can have a relationship to an A object.

0:11:06.660,0:11:08.190
That's exactly what we have here.

0:11:08.190,0:11:12.240
So this is a
manifestation of that relationship.

0:11:12.240,0:11:14.230
And these "0..*" or

0:11:14.230,0:11:23.660
"0..1" multiplicities are also
satisfied in the case here.

0:11:23.660,0:11:34.270
Okay, again this part, this is not at all different
from the case of (b), in the case of this

0:11:34.270,0:11:35.270
subtask.

0:11:35.270,0:11:38.840
That is, of course, that corresponds
to this relationship here.

0:11:38.840,0:11:43.050
So there are no other changes here.

0:11:43.050,0:11:45.940
The (c) fits the first class diagram.

0:11:45.940,0:11:50.480
Does (c) also fit
the second class diagram?

0:11:50.480,0:11:54.600
Let's take a look at that.

0:11:54.600,0:12:01.420
This will certainly raise the question
again, what justifies this link

0:12:01.420,0:12:02.420
here.

0:12:02.420,0:12:06.339
And we can't justify it now by
the fact that B inherits from A.

0:12:06.339,0:12:09.300
Now A inherits from B.

0:12:09.300,0:12:16.710
So with what right should a B-object
have a link to an A-object like here?

0:12:16.710,0:12:22.510
If we look at the class diagram, "b" only
has relationships to C and D objects.

0:12:22.510,0:12:26.060
A does inherit from B, but that means:

0:12:26.060,0:12:28.340
A can have all
the relationships that B has.

0:12:28.340,0:12:32.279
It does not mean B can have
relationships that A has.

0:12:32.279,0:12:35.520
So "b" may only have
relations to C and D objects.

0:12:35.520,0:12:38.760
To a D-object there
is such a relation here.

0:12:38.760,0:12:44.870
But this link here from a B object to an
A object, it's not justified or covered

0:12:44.870,0:12:47.680
or allowed for the second class diagram.

0:12:47.680,0:12:51.970
So (c) doesn't match
the second class diagram.

0:12:51.970,0:13:00.960
Okay, how about (d)?

0:13:00.960,0:13:11.040
Does (d) fit the first class diagram?

0:13:11.040,0:13:12.440
What's different about (d) now?

0:13:12.440,0:13:18.360
Now I have only A objects "a1",
"a2", "a3", all three from class A.

0:13:18.360,0:13:25.279
And here there is an A object that has
relationships to two other A objects.

0:13:25.279,0:13:28.610
So "a1" has relations to "a2" and "a3".

0:13:28.610,0:13:34.430
That would have to
be a manifestation of this.

0:13:34.430,0:13:40.080
And there we see, however, that
this is an illegal relationship.

0:13:40.080,0:13:42.460
Insofar as they can't both exist.

0:13:42.460,0:13:52.310
Namely this one A-object has relations
concerning this association circled above

0:13:52.310,0:13:55.730
to two other A-objects.

0:13:55.730,0:14:02.330
But here the multiplicity specified at this
end, the one being navigated to (that we

0:14:02.330,0:14:07.090
see indeed from this arrow here, that this
end clearly corresponds to these two ends):

0:14:07.090,0:14:15.550
It says as multiplicity that this
can only be a relation to at most

0:14:15.550,0:14:16.550
one A-object.

0:14:16.550,0:14:17.550
That is:

0:14:17.550,0:14:21.790
What we see down here in
the object diagram is wrong.

0:14:21.790,0:14:25.070
It violates that multiplicity here.

0:14:25.070,0:14:29.310
Okay, how about the second class diagram?

0:14:29.310,0:14:35.529
Maybe it fits there.

0:14:35.529,0:14:38.650
Does (d) fit the second class diagram?

0:14:38.650,0:14:42.170
And the answer is:

0:14:42.170,0:14:46.680
So B, C, D objects don't exist at all.

0:14:46.680,0:14:51.910
So neither requirements nor
prohibitions can arise concerning them.

0:14:51.910,0:14:54.940
We just have to look at A.

0:14:54.940,0:14:59.850
The fact that A inherits from
B doesn't matter in this case.

0:14:59.850,0:15:03.870
Because only possible relations
to C and D would result from it.

0:15:03.870,0:15:10.390
But these are not obligatory in each case,
because here just "0..1" and implicitly

0:15:10.390,0:15:11.390
"0..*".

0:15:11.390,0:15:17.720
So A inherits these two relations from
B, but no obligations result from it,

0:15:17.720,0:15:19.930
only possibilities.

0:15:19.930,0:15:25.740
And how is it with these two
relations and this relation?

0:15:25.740,0:15:28.790
These two links are covered
by that relationship up there.

0:15:28.790,0:15:30.110
Because it says:

0:15:30.110,0:15:40.589
An A-object can be related (in the
end it says "0..*") with any number

0:15:40.589,0:15:41.800
of other A-objects.

0:15:41.800,0:15:45.330
So for example also with two.

0:15:45.330,0:15:51.070
And vice versa, so to say in backward
direction, in this direction:

0:15:51.070,0:15:54.460
"a2" and "a3" may each be related

0:15:54.460,0:16:00.140
to "0..*" A-objects in this direction.

0:16:00.140,0:16:06.160
In this multiplicity, of course,
having a partner here falls into this

0:16:06.160,0:16:07.160
interval.

0:16:07.160,0:16:13.820
So (d) fits the second class diagram,
although it had not fit the first.

0:16:13.820,0:16:21.149
Okay, and then finally
the questions for (e).

0:16:21.149,0:16:26.121
So how about for (e)?

0:16:26.121,0:16:28.750
Does (e) fit the first class diagram?

0:16:28.750,0:16:33.180
Now the As have disappeared.

0:16:33.180,0:16:36.250
So there are no A objects.

0:16:36.250,0:16:42.029
There is a B object, which is also an A
object because of the inheritance here.

0:16:42.029,0:16:48.920
So we have to look at what the
requirements are because of that.

0:16:48.920,0:16:55.240
But because the relation here above is so liberal
(since the multiplicities always allow for

0:16:55.240,0:17:03.680
the number of counterparts to be
zero), there are no further obligations

0:17:03.680,0:17:04.750
for the B object.

0:17:04.750,0:17:09.039
So that's harmless there.

0:17:09.039,0:17:15.510
And what about the C and D relations?

0:17:15.510,0:17:19.909
So "b" may be related
to any number of D objects.

0:17:19.909,0:17:21.850
That would be these two in this case.

0:17:21.850,0:17:27.279
It does not have to be related to C
objects, because here the multiplicity is

0:17:27.279,0:17:28.700
implicitly "0..*".

0:17:28.700,0:17:36.429
And every D object must be related to exactly
one B object, because of this specification here.

0:17:36.429,0:17:37.869
But that is also the case here.

0:17:37.869,0:17:41.320
Yes, each D object is related
to exactly one B object.

0:17:41.320,0:17:45.529
That these two D objects are both
related to the same B object is not

0:17:45.529,0:17:47.019
a big deal.

0:17:47.019,0:17:52.980
Because that is allowed from the B point of
view to be related to any number of D objects.

0:17:52.980,0:17:55.960
So (e) fits the first class diagram.

0:17:55.960,0:18:04.519
And then as a final question, I wonder
if (e) also fits the second class

0:18:04.519,0:18:05.519
diagram here.

0:18:05.519,0:18:12.369
And how is that?

0:18:12.369,0:18:19.299
There is a problem
with this multiplicity here.

0:18:19.299,0:18:25.919
Because each B object may only be
related to at most one D object.

0:18:25.919,0:18:31.840
But here there are these
two counterparts for "b".

0:18:31.840,0:18:36.440
So these two links can only be variations
of this relationship.

0:18:36.440,0:18:40.330
Because there are no other relationships between
B and D, not even by inheritance somehow.

0:18:40.330,0:18:45.259
And then this multiplicity, which
is required here, is violated.

0:18:45.259,0:18:51.289
The "b" should not have any D partner
or have a D partner, but not multiple.

0:18:51.289,0:19:00.080
Each B object is allowed to have at most
one D object as a counterpart along a link

0:19:00.080,0:19:01.289
for that association.

0:19:01.289,0:19:03.019
And that is apparently violated here.

0:19:03.019,0:19:06.390
So (e) does not match the second class diagram.

0:19:06.390,0:19:11.139
Thus, we have discussed all cases.
