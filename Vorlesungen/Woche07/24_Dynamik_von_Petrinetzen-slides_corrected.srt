00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,580
In this video, we will again look at
a few formal aspects of Petri nets.

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,570
Reminder:

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,740
We had formally defined Petri
nets as a tuple containing a set

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,950
of places S and a set of transitions
T, plus various other ingredients.

00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:32,640
Among them were markings, i.e., functions from
the set of places S into the natural numbers.

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,450
No negative numbers, but
zero and positive integers.

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,990
That was used, among other things,
to express the pre- and post-weights.

00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,090
These were these special functions.

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,410
For individual transitions, respectively
the precondition weights and the

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,110
postcondition weights as such markings.

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:59,070
The connection to the graphical representation
was, first, that the initial marking m0

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,930
corresponded to the occupancy of the places
at the beginning on the graphical page.

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,670
There, the marking function
m0 would be used to count

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,550
exactly the tokens for each place
shown in the graphical representation.

00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,490
And the arrows in the graphical
representation correspond

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,780
exactly to the pre- and
post-weights in a certain way.

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:32,460
In particular, if there is to be no arrow from
s to t or from t to s (in each case in the

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:40,110
appropriate order), it can be inferred from
this whether the pre-weight condition function

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,490
for that transition carries the value zero
with respect to the corresponding place.

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,530
Or analogously for
the post-weight function:

00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,730
If there are zeros in the
mathematical representation, there

00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,500
is simply no arrow in the
graphical representation.

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,390
Then there was the situation that there
was an arrow, but there was nothing on it.

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,830
This would correspond to the

00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,530
cases where the pre-weight and post-weight functions
for the corresponding transition and place are 1.

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,290
Differently, we had seen in the tool

00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,030
that there the arrows are
always labeled with a 1.

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,860
So even with the arrows that
would carry a 1 and therefore in

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,290
the simplified graphical representation
in the slides, for example,

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,110
are not labeled with a number, the 1
was still explicitly there in the tool.

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,530
On the slides, I actually write the
weights only if they are greater than 1.

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,960
So if the pre-weight and post-weight

00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,190
condition for a transition and
place is an integer greater than

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,400
1, then there would be an arrow
on the slides or in the exercises.

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
If there is nothing on
it, then it is a 1.

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,480
And in the tool, the
1 is even written on it.

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,630
That's just a repetition.

00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,030
This is nothing new that I told you.

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,150
You've already seen that and
you've also practiced that.

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,845
Then now we're going to operate with these
"ingredients," specifically these markings.

00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:11,560
We're going to have a couple of
terms and a couple of definitions

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,470
that are defined for markings and because
of that, they then apply to the initial

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,110
marking as well as they can be used for
these pre-weight and post-weight functions.

00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:27,700
And also for other markings that arise in
the course of the development of a Petri net.

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,740
So not just the initial
marking, but also markings

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,000
that may be present, for example, after
some transitions have been executed.

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,200
And then we just need some
mathematical terms and applications.

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,170
So on the one hand,
there will be an order

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,080
on markings, and on the other
hand, certain operations.

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,290
On this slide, first
of all, to the order.

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,730
We'll consider any two
markings for the same

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,070
Petri net, so for the same set of places.

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,940
Then we have two markings, that is, mappings
from these places to natural numbers.

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,010
I'll call them m and m'.

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,570
The m' has nothing
to do with derivatives.

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,126
It's not like the
derivative notation: f and f'.

00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,350
They are just two different names.

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,930
You could have also said m1, m2.

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,430
And then how is it defined that
m' is less than or equal to m?

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,730
If it is true for all places from the

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,750
corresponding underlying set that m'
of s is less than or equal to m of s.

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,220
So, that at the place
s the marking m' carries a

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,730
smaller value or the same value
as m at the corresponding place.

00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,850
And this must be true for all places.

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,940
Then we say that the marking m' is altogether
less than or equal to the marking m.

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,850
That's not about what the sum of
the numbers for the marking is.

00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,530
How many tokens there are in total.

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,690
Instead, it must be true for each

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,555
place that m' carries a smaller value
or at most the same value as m.

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,960
Then we also say: m' is covered by m.

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,720
Finally, we check that m has at least
as many tokens as m' for each place.

00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,060
So, does m cover m'?

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,530
Example:

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,090
Suppose our set of
places S is three-elementary.

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,430
We have already said that we can write
down such finite functions by simply

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,360
specifying (in that case) a triple, because
there are supposed to be three places.

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,090
Then our m could be the triple (0,1,2).

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:41,480
And m', of course seen for the same
order of places, the triple (0,0,1).

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,780
And then it would indeed hold here that m' is
less than or equal to m, but not vice versa.

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,920
Why is m' <= m?

00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,590
Because 0 is less than or equal to 0, and 0 is less
than or equal to 1, and 1 is less than or equal to 2.

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,730
But the reverse is not true.

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,710
The 0 <= 0 is still true, but not 1 <= 0.

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:09,800
In that case, we would say that
marking is covered by this marking.

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,125
It really depends on the
comparison of each element.

00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:15,890
Also, this is still true:

00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,900
Every marking is
covered by itself, trivially,

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,160
because it is less than or equal,
namely equal, at every position.

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,890
But what is not true
is for example this one.

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:31,820
So although the second marking
here is much fuller in a place

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,570
(1000), which is much larger than
everything in the first marking.

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,010
Nevertheless, this marking
is not covered by this one.

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,330
Why not?

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,390
Because it is not
true in the third place.

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,940
But it would have to be true
for every place that the

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,860
number, which stands here, is smaller than
or equal to the number, which stands there.

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,690
This is the case for 3 and 5 and
for 1000, but not for 2 and 1.

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,290
Sometimes it is simply not the
case that the coverage exists.

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,740
And it may also be that it is
not present in either direction.

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,440
This was already the case here,
and indeed also here.

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:11,300
Although here in both markings simply the numbers
0, 1, 2 occur, it is neither the case that

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,150
the first marking is covered
by the second, nor vice versa.

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,980
Because there is in each case a place, namely
either the second or the third position,

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,290
where in each case it is violated
that this applies to all places.

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,950
So this is how we can compare two
markings, be it the initial marking

00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,410
and a weight marking, or two weight

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,640
markings, or just two markings that occur
later in the development of the Petri net.

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:48,140
We'll write this "<=", which is what
you're most likely to know for numbers.

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,230
Mathematicians like to use
this for all sorts of

00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,900
structures, including such
marking functions, for example.

00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,950
Then it said something about operations.

00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,440
This is just an
order relation, not an operation.

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,690
So nothing that creates a new marking.

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,520
But there are some of these,
especially the addition.

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,030
So if we have
again two such markings, for

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,640
the same set of places, then we define
a third marking, which is the sum.

00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,550
Now here's this somewhat funny
plus with a circle around it.

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,790
That's simply choosing a symbol
that's not the obvious plus (which

00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,150
you know from numbers), but
still reminds you of addition.

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,540
That's where people like to take
symbols of about that shape.

00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,170
So a plus in a circle, because
it's not the plus on numbers.

00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,260
Not 3 + 5, but the plus
between two such markings.

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,050
What comes out of it?

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,840
A marking, which must be a function
of S into the natural numbers.

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,980
And how is it defined?

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,850
Place-wise.

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:56,260
So for each element of S, we define
our new marking as given at that

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,860
place, by the sum of the two
original markings at the same place.

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,080
That's simply a definition.

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,020
So for each s,
we define a natural number.

00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,300
And then that is the result
marking of that addition.

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,360
For example, if again for the
three-element set S we have the markings

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,750
(0,1,2) and (0,0,1), then
their sum would again be a

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,310
marking for this three-element
place set, therefore a triple.

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:34,600
And that is 0 + 0 = 0, 1
+ 0 = 1, and 2 + 1 = 3.

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,250
So this is like vector addition.

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,720
If you were to
write things down vertically,

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,910
that would be a triple vector
and another triple vector.

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,860
You know this from
school (linear algebra): there

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,560
just results a vector,
element-wise/place-wise added.

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,590
Exactly the same
happens for these markings.

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,970
You can do that for addition.

00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,770
You can do the same for subtraction.

00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,210
Then you just have
to be a little careful,

00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,755
because it says here that it
always has to be natural numbers.

00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:07,270
And it's unfortunately not
the case that when you

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,740
subtract any two natural numbers, the
result is always a natural number.

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,850
For example, with 3 and 5 this is not the case,
3 + 5 = 8 but 3 - 5 is not a natural number.

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,410
Therefore, subtraction is
defined only for the case where

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:29,110
we want to subtract from m a
marking that is covered by m.

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,820
Here we use the relation, the
order, from the slide before.

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,840
So if m' <= m, as defined before,

00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,130
then we can say the subtraction
of m and m' is in that order:

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,240
For each place, it must hold that
the new marking at the place no

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,450
longer carries as its value the sum, but
the difference of the two original markings.

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,490
The order is, of course, important.

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:00,760
That we subtract m' from m and
not vice versa. Here it is okay.

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,740
There will actually come out a natural

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,620
number if we knew before
that m' is covered by m.

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,960
Because then it is exactly the case that
this difference can never be negative.

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,040
So that will then fit exactly.

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,560
Again, an example: (0,1,2)
minus (0,0,1) would be (0,1,1).

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,260
So don't add element by element,
but subtract element by element.

00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,040
We may not turn this around here;
here above, of course, already.

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,330
Here above for the sum we
could have also written:

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,750
What is written here as second
plus what is written here as first.

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:42,340
This is also defined and results in the same
triple because this addition is commutative.

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,990
That does not apply
here for the subtraction,

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,790
because this condition would not be
fulfilled then for the other direction.

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,090
Then we can use these terms now.

00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,820
These were only definitions of
mathematical kind for these markings.

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,340
This doesn't yet have anything
directly to do with Petri nets.

00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,150
But we want to use just that to describe

00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,130
the dynamics, the semantics, the meaning
(ultimately the execution) of Petri nets.

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,310
What was important there?

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,600
Being activated.

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,650
Is a transition in a Petri net activated?

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,480
Only then can anything happen.

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
And what happens then?

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,470
The transition fires and
leads to a new marking, to a

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,270
new allocation of the
places in the Petri net.

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,130
We can now formally define these two
concepts using the terms we have seen.

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,770
So first the activation.

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,420
When is a transition activated
for a particular marking?

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,510
So we have to have a marking, we
have to know where the tokens are.

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,000
And then we can look
at a transition and ask

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,570
if that transition is activated
right now for the current marking.

00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,540
That's the case when the
pre-weight function for that

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,710
particular transition is
covered by the current marking.

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,960
This means exactly that at all places
where this transition expects tokens, i.e.,

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,060
where the function value of
this function is greater than

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,770
0, the marking m also contains at least
as many tokens (or maybe even more).

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,090
This must be true for every place.

00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,860
A transition can already not fire if

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,020
there are not enough tokens in the current
marking for one of its input places.

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,580
What is written here in the parentheses
is simply the verbalization of what

00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:42,090
the definition of the order relation
of the penultimate slide provides here.

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,450
So it succinctly captures when
a transition is activated.

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,160
And when it is, it can fire.

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,530
So, let t be a transition and m be a
marking such that t is activated for m.

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,480
Then it can fire.

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,030
This means that a new marking comes out.

00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,930
And what does it look like?

00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,660
We can now rewrite it with
our subtraction/addition.

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,950
Intuitively we had said:

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,340
We take correspondingly
many tokens from all

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,140
places of the precondition, that
is, with incoming arrows to t.

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,840
Where "correspondingly many"
depends on what this

00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,570
function says here
for the individual places.

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:21,630
And on the other hand, afterwards
we add suitably many tokens to the

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,890
post-weight places, that is, to the places for which
this post-weight function has a positive value.

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,750
This is exactly the same as saying:

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,090
We take the current
marking, subtract from it the

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,430
pre-weight function for the corresponding t,
and add the post-weight function on top of it.

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,950
After all, this is the same transition in
each case, and it is the one we are firing.

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,660
And we must know beforehand that t is
really activated for this marking m.

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,590
Because only then can we
form this subtraction.

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,310
So this all fits together with the condition
in the previous slide about when we're

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,990
allowed to form the
subtraction in the first place.

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,910
Things play together exactly so
that it makes sense overall.

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,710
What's meant by the parentheses here is:

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,540
First we subtract, and then we add.

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,630
You could have added parentheses there.

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,920
If that is so, then we also want to express
more concisely: m becomes m' when t is fired.

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,360
And that is how it is written.

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:32,520
This is a syntax formulated as a formula

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,420
for: t now fires from here
to there and out comes m'.

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,010
And this is exactly the m' which results
from these arithmetic operations.

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,900
That would be a step.

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,230
So from a marking, we
make a step with a certain

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,280
transition and get a
certain new marking m'.

00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,190
That could happen to be the same one.

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,030
But generally some marking m'.

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:05,760
Then obviously m' is reachable
in a step from m.

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,686
This can still be generalized
or taken in a different way.

00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:12,000
Namely, one can ask whether any marking,

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,270
not necessarily m', but any
other marking, is reachable from m.

00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,890
Perhaps even in several steps.

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,650
This leads to our next definition.

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:25,680
We say a marking
is reachable, usually from m0.

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,450
So we have a start
marking for the Petri net.

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,680
We wonder if some other
marking is reachable from it.

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,500
How is this defined and
when is it the case?

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,960
When there is a
certain sequence of transitions.

00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,590
This could be a single transition,
it could be zero, it could be 27,

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,350
but somehow a finite sequence t_1 to t_n.

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,620
In that, transitions may
occur more than once.

00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,200
So maybe our Petri
net has three transitions,

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,100
but we want to have a 27-long sequence.

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,350
Then at least one transition
must occur more than once.

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:06,180
So any transitions t_1 to t_n,
possibly occurring more than once, so

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:13,620
that m0 becomes m1 by firing t1, exactly this m1
becomes m3 by firing t2, and so on, and so on.

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,440
And in the end, our m comes out, which
we wondered if it is reachable from m0.

00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:26,880
And if it is, then m is called
reachable from the initial marking.

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,140
Sometimes we don't even care what
these intermediate markings are.

00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,920
Then we only want to know that we
can get from m0 to m by t_1 to t_n.

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,930
Then this is also written shortened as: just
m0, then all transitions are written here

00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,460
directly in these special brackets
(not each one separately),

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,300
and we write only the end marking there
(not also all intermediate markings).

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:59,640
Or if we summarized this list
t_1 to t_n, as here t-"snake", so

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,780
another identifier; then we also write, m0
passes into m under this whole sequence.

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,010
The sequence is then
called a firing sequence.

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,350
These are exactly the lists that show
up in the tool in the previous video in

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,160
the left window, but
written one below the other.

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,890
I had single transitions
in my Petri nets.

00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:29,520
There I simulated, started
executions, and carried out firings,

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,200
and in the left window the transitions
always appeared under each other.

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,310
That would be such a firing sequence.

00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,370
At the beginning it was empty.

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,260
One can also have
the empty firing sequence.

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,740
Then, of course, the m is
necessarily equal to the m0.

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,680
Each marking, also the initial marking

00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,280
m0, passes under empty firing
sequence naturally into itself.

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,220
One can also have the situation that
there is only the empty firing sequence.

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,870
If I have no activated transitions at all
in the initial marking of the Petri net,

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,525
then the only possible firing
sequence is the empty firing sequence.

00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:10,620
But in general, it will
be the case that we will

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,220
have finite and non-empty transition
sequences that are fireable.

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,780
Then we have an interesting model.

00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:22,040
That was the definition.

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,470
Let's talk through this
with a concrete example.

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,380
This is the example I had on
a slide last week where we

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,300
were talking about the equivalence of
graphical and mathematical representation.

00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,820
So there is a slide,
in last week's slides, where

00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,450
the mathematical representation
is given for this.

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,630
We need that here now as well,
because these terms refer to that,

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,010
especially these marking functions.

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:55,700
Here we have the initial marking,
that would be marking m0, of course

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,400
(1,2,0) because I have the
place order s1, s2, s3.

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,060
So the initial marking here
would be: first component

00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,690
1, second component 2, third component 0.

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:11,480
Now it is claimed here that the marking
m2 = (1,1,1) is reachable in two steps.

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,760
Intuitively, this means it
must be possible to

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
perform exactly two
firings of transitions so

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:28,355
that somehow the tokens move in such a way that
afterwards there is exactly one token on each position.

00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:29,810
That's what this marking here says.

00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,660
And we can just try
that out and do the math.

00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:40,220
We can see that of these three transitions,
only t1 is activated at the beginning anyway.

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,950
Therefore, the first firing
really has to happen with t1.

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:52,250
The pre-weight function for t1 is (1,1,0), because
there must be something on the first two places.

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,420
There are incoming arrows, and
without a number written on them,

00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,400
so this corresponds to weight 1.

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,010
There is no incoming arrow from
s3 to t1, so this is zero.

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,100
That's what it had said
on the slide last week.

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,530
This marking is covered
by the start marking.

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,290
The m0 in this case would be (1,2,0).

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:23,300
There this relation is valid,
because at every position the value,

00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,730
which is here, is at least
as high as the value here.

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,280
So firing is possible in the first place.

00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,540
Of course we already knew
this by looking at this

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,440
graphic, but mathematically
this is well defined.

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,220
What do we get then?

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,890
The next marking is our start marking

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:46,130
m0 minus the pre-weight function for t1,
plus the post-weight function for t1.

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,860
There we could also look at the old slides
and it would say that this is (0,0,2).

00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:58,550
Ultimately because there are no arrows from t1
to s1 and s2, but there is this 2 arrow to s3.

00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,160
So we have this calculation:

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:08,450
We have (1,2,0) as m0,
minus (1,1,0), plus (0,0,2).

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,720
Then calculating element
by element we get (0,1,2).

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,690
1 - 1 + 0 = 0, 2 - 1 +
0 = 1, and 0 - 0 + 2 = 2.

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,600
So the marking m1 after firing t1 in
the start situation is this marking.

00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,960
Now if we want to
know what happens in two steps,

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,570
we have to make the next step starting
from this, not from m0 anymore.

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:42,710
We can see, this current marking
(0,1,2) covers the pre-weight of t2.

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,990
The pre-weight function of t2 is (0,0,1)
because it only takes something from s3.

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,920
This (0,0,1) is covered by
it, so t2 is executable.

00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,230
Then m2 is the current marking m1
minus exactly this (0,0,1), so it

00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,190
is the pre-weight function of t2,
plus the post-weight function of t2.

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,510
If we look there what happens:

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,880
t2 puts a token after s1 and nothing
else, so the function is (1,0,0).

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:19,070
As a calculation, we get from up
here: (0,1,2) - (0,0,1) + (1,0,0).

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,830
And if we do this again element by
element, we get the marking (1,1,1).

00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:30,710
So after firing t1 and t2, from the
original marking, we would reach the

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,560
situation as it is claimed here above, where
on all three places there is exactly one token.

00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:43,830
So it is valid: m0 under
firing of t1 passes to this

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,150
m1, and under firing of
t2 this passes to this m2.

00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,630
Or written shorter (if we
don't want to note the m1 at

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,130
all): m0 passes to m2
under firing of t1 and t2.

00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,430
Calculated this way.

00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,380
Of course, we will not always
recalculate this in such detail.

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,800
But it must be understood,

00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,700
because later definitions
will work with these terms.

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,240
Often, we will certainly just
work with intuition, based

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,022
on the graphical representation.

00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:14,097
That's what I did in the modeling
example in the previous video.

00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:20,250
I didn't always do the math, but

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,090
simply worked with the tool
and the intuition behind it.

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:32,250
It is still important that this is now
simply the firing for this concrete sequence.

00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,330
So it's not that m0 always does
this and then m2 comes out.

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,510
But here it only states that
m0 can transition to this specific marking m2

00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,450
by firing t1 and t2.

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,510
There can also be other firing sequences
starting from m0.

00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:51,570
In the concrete case for example
it is also valid that m0 reaches

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,400
m1 after firing t1 as above, but after
that also t3 would have been fireable.

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,230
So a different transition than t2.

00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,230
And then a completely different
final marking would have come out.

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,300
This is not a contradiction or wrong.

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,220
But the firing always refers to a
concrete sequence of transitions.

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,610
For other transitions of course
another marking can come out.

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,790
This follows mathematically
from the definition.

00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:20,790
But this is also an essential property
of Petri nets, namely non-determinism.

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:26,340
That is, it is possible, in the same
situation, for example situation m1 (which

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:33,990
we have reached here), to evolve
differently for different transitions.

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,140
The term for this is "non-determinism".

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,770
Petri nets are non-deterministic,
not predetermined.

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:47,830
That is, there can be multiple direct
successor markings to a concrete marking.

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,750
Of course, there can always
be several successor markings,

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,400
since we are considering several steps.

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,170
But even for the next concrete step
there can be different results.

00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,750
Of course only if
we apply different transitions.

00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,070
So the same marking
and the same transition lead

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,590
to the same successor marking.

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:11,770
We can't get different
markings from m1 with t1.

00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:21,250
But here with m1 and t2 or m1
and t3 we get different markings.

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,310
If we have a marking, and we can choose

00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:28,660
different transitions, we can get
different new markings in the process.

00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,530
Now at this point, from the student
side, the question likes to come:

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,740
Who decides that?

00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,530
Who chooses the transition?

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,150
Or who chooses which of the several
successor markings is the right one?

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,420
For modeling, this
question does not arise.

00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,860
That is not our goal in modeling.

00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,320
In modeling, we want to
describe all possibilities.

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,180
Nowhere in the Petri net does
it say which transition to take.

00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,320
The Petri net describes, under a certain
constellation, which transitions are possible.

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,970
And also expresses what
this does to the marking.

00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,810
What the next marking would
be for a chosen transition.

00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:11,290
The model does not make a selection
of which transition to take.

00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,590
That might be a
task for implementing a system

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,140
previously modeled with Petri nets.

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,290
Perhaps one wants to follow
certain protocols in a

00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,500
concrete executable system.

00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:29,020
So choosing certain strategies among all
the possibilities given by the model.

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,790
But that is no
longer part of the modeling.

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,560
This is an important concept.

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,230
Without non-determinism, Petri
nets would not be as interesting.

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:46,180
And because Petri nets are nondeterministic
(i.e., different subsequent markings can

00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,340
arise from one marking), if we

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,880
want to get an overview of how a
Petri net can evolve, there is a very

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,260
natural relationship to the flat state
diagrams from the beginning of the lecture.

00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,750
We will turn to the evolution of a graph

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:15,340
from a Petri net, corresponding to
reachability relations, in the next video.
