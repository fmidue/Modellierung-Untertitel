00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
In the previous video I had spoken towards
the end of the non-determinism with Petri nets.

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:17,040
Especially in the execution, i.e. that
there can be several activated transitions for

00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,860
a marking, which can then
also lead to different subsequent markings.

00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,170
And I had already mentioned that
this results in a graph which

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,860
ultimately corresponds to
a flat state diagram.

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,800
And that is the flat state
diagram of exactly this Petri net.

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,790
That is now defined here on this slide.

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,050
I'll talk through that briefly and
then we'll see it on an example.

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,270
And it will be practiced, of course.

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,600
So, given a Petri net.

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,820
We know how this is mathematically given by
these five components: place set, transition set, pre-weight

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,500
functions, post-weight
functions, start marking.

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,120
And then we assign a flat
state diagram to this Petri net.

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,485
This always consists
of certain components

00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,930
as defined mathematically earlier (where
we looked at graphs in general).

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,330
So there is the node set.

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,060
This is often called V for "vertices".

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,600
Or we can call it Z
for states, because of the state diagram.

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,000
And for that, we choose the
set of all markings reachable from m0.

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,590
Using exactly the reachability
notion that was defined here.

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,760
So any marking m that is
reachable in this way by a

00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,320
finite sequence of transitions from m0
is packed into this set Z.

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,760
Reminder:

00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,090
A Petri net
configuration, i.e. an assignment

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,670
of places of the Petri net with
tokens, corresponds to a state of the system.

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,250
Therefore it makes sense to choose exactly
that as the states in the state diagram.

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,990
Of course only the reachable markings.

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,670
Not all conceivable markings.

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,000
Because markings, which are not reachable
from the start marking, contribute nothing

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,360
to the understanding of the Petri net.

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,790
They can never be realized anyway.

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,140
Okay, then there is
the set of edge labels.

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,100
In a flat state diagram, after all,
we could label the edges between the nodes.

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,530
And for that here we
choose the set of transitions.

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,330
So on each edge between nodes
we will write a transition, namely

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,130
the transition that
led to this transition.

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,960
Which was activated
in the original marking

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,120
before the transition, and led
exactly to the subsequent state.

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:55,920
Then we get as edge set, or
transitions, exactly the triples consisting of marking,

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,030
transition, subsequent marking, for
which this relationship holds.

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,800
So we don't just
link any markings together.

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,710
But we have a transition from
m to m' with the label

00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:23,280
t, so with label t at the
arrow, exactly when t is activated in

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,020
marking m, and after firing
exactly the marking m' arises.

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,960
Thus we have all
nodes, all edges, their labels.

00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,140
As a rule, in a flat
state diagram, we still designate a

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,830
special state, namely the start state.

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,470
And here, logically, this
is the initial marking.

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,350
This is one of
these reachable markings, because

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,770
it is reachable after
the empty transition sequence.

00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:55,200
So it fits, is an
element of the relevant state set.

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:03,600
Okay, so that's our flat state
diagram for our given Petri net.

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,360
And this is also
called the reachability graph.

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,410
It's a graph that represents
all the reachable markings, and

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,260
of course makes it clear
via the labels on the

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,870
edges how a particular
marking can be reached.

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,900
So in the end the firing
sequence can be traced in the graph.

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,010
This can become an infinite graph.

00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,600
The Petri net is always finite.

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,760
The set S was finite,
the set T was finite, but

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,625
the reachability graph could
well be an infinite graph.

00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:38,770
While every firing sequence is finite, there
may be an infinite number of them.

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,740
We're not going to consider
that here at the moment.

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,220
So here at the moment we will only
see an example of a finite reachability graph.

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,890
But we'll also come back to
at least one example of infinity later.

00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,810
There the definition is unchanged, the
development is in principle also the

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,040
same, only of course you can't
paint an infinite graph on a slide

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,750
in finite time, as I'm about to
do now here for the example in sequence.

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,300
And that is, let's look at
exactly the reachability graph for this

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,820
Petri net, which we've
now seen several times.

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,200
That was our example Petri net
on the slides for the connection

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,180
between graphical
and mathematical representation.

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,720
And it was also the example that
I had used in an earlier video this

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,230
week for illustrating the mathematical
formulation of firing and reachability.

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,820
It helps, of course, to have
already done that for this example.

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,070
Because then we already know part of

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,980
the reachability graph directly now.

00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,720
So, what will this
graph look like for this?

00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,860
It will be on the next slide.

00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,500
But I would like to
talk through the first few states,

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,100
so to speak, and then
just leave the graph to you.

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,660
So that you can look for or check
the rest of the transitions in there yourself.

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,210
So, by definition, this is a
graph that contains all all reachable

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,720
markings, especially, of course,
at least the initial marking.

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,540
And in fact, when we
set up such a reachability graph,

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,190
we start with the
initial marking, of course.

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,630
Because we already know that it

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,700
has to be present in the graph.

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,590
So, what is the start marking here?

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,590
Of course, we first have to agree on
how we want to write down the markings.

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,300
I had once said:

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,970
We like to use
tuples, in this case triples.

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,770
For this we have to decide in
which order we want to use the places.

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,100
And if they are called s1, s2, s3,

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,100
it is obvious to write
them down in this order.

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,520
So, the start marking as
a triple would be (1,2,0),

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,740
because these are the tokens on
the three places in the start state.

00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,050
So that would explain this
part from this solution here.

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,700
You take (1,2,0) as the
first marking and also mark it

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,360
with this input
arrow as the start marking.

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,470
And then you have to
find more nodes, all reachable markings.

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,430
That means, you have to ask now, starting

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,130
from this start marking, which
is already in the graph:

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,470
What are the reachable markings?

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,550
And for this one must
look, which of the given transitions,

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:32,290
which exist in the Petri net, are
then fireable in the marking just present?

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,220
At the beginning, this
is the start marking.

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,980
That is, we simply have to consider:

00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,930
What is fireable in this situation?

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,000
And in fact, only t1 is fireable.

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,620
And we already know
what comes out of that.

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,120
For one thing, we can check it.

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
Then there would be
two tokens down here afterwards.

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,330
So (0,1,2) would be the
next marking, after firing t1.

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,450
But we already know that,
because we have recalculated it here.

00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,470
That was exactly the point:

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:59,980
From the start marking (1,2,0) we can
get this next marking by firing with t1.

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,790
So it is reachable, and therefore it
has to appear in the reachability graph.

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:10,690
And this would be exactly
the extension to this part.

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,480
So we would build up
the graph piece by piece now.

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,400
We started with (1,2,0) and we know:

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,620
After firing t1 we end up at (0,1,2).

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,870
There would be no
further arrows for the time

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,330
being, because no other transitions
are activated in the start marking.

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,550
Then we would look next:

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,380
Well, if there are
no more transitions from

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,120
it, what about this new marking (0,1,2)?

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,460
Are there any transitions from it?

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,870
For this we would have to
think of this token here set differently.

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,130
Now it is no
longer about the start marking,

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,870
but about the current marking (0,1,2).

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,900
So, if nothing lies here, one
token lies here, and here two,

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,730
which transition would be fireable then?

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,280
The t1 would not be fireable,
because of the imaginary zero here.

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,150
But t2 and t3 would both be
fireable, because they depend only on tokens in

00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,500
s3, where now two would lie.

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,830
So we would know, next
t2 and t3 would be fireable.

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,190
And of course, we
also saw exactly that earlier.

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,020
Namely, in this example we had also
considered exactly from the marking m1, which is

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,780
present after firing t1, and finally
calculated that t2 and t3 are fireable,

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,450
and that thereby the two
markings (1,1,1) and (0,2,1) arise.

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:29,200
We can now plot this
on our graph in progress.

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,040
So we would extend the
piece we already had now.

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,420
On the one hand by
(with transition t2) the node (1,1,1),

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,060
and on the other hand by
(per transition t3) the subsequent marking (0,2,1).

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:53,770
So then we would have developed
this part of the graph, so to

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,980
speak, still without the arrows
going in the opposite direction.

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,110
So these four states and the initial marking

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,390
arrow, plus these three arrows here.

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:10,600
Then we would also know that we're not
going to have any more transitions from this node.

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,650
Because t2 and t3 are
activated and that's just about it.

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,060
So next we would look at
the two new states and think

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,100
about what is fireable from these.

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,700
But I don't have that
now already on existing slides.

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,520
So I didn't have any
more things calculated through here.

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,000
But of course you can do
the same considerations for the new markings.

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,940
Or take the Petri
net, think away these markings,

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,170
instead for example consider the situation, where
on each place exactly one token lies.

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,990
In order to consider how
it could go on from here.

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,940
So, what would happen if there were
exactly one token here, here and here?

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,250
Which transitions would
be activated then?

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:54,610
All of them!

00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,980
Transition t1 because
of these two inputs.

00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,140
Transition t2 because of this input.

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,000
Transition t3 because of this input.

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,200
So because of the presence of
a token on each relevant input.

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,700
That means, from the marking
(1,1,1) all three transitions are fireable.

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,960
This would lead to the fact that we
must actually have three outgoing arrows from (1,1,1).

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,260
And if we then calculate in
each case what comes out as a

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,670
subsequent marking, we find out, for example, that
if we execute t1, we come to (0,0,3).

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,080
So this state is added.

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,360
But we also notice:

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,120
If we fire t3 from (1,1,1), then

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,230
we would come to the
marking (1,2 0), which already exists.

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:42,160
Of course, we then do not
make a new node here with (1,2,0).

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,420
After all, we have a graph.

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:50,080
That is, we simply have a
back arrow labeled t3 in that case.

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,410
And it turns out that we
can still get here with t2.

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,550
Okay, and so we extend
the graph piece by piece.

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,630
For each new state we always

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,160
check which further transitions
are fireable from there.

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,410
If this leads to new nodes, we add them.

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,480
And for those we have to check again,

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,780
which further transitions are
possible starting from there.

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,730
If, on the other hand, we have
a backward arrow (like the one from

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,080
here to here), we don't have to look
again to see what is possible from this marking.

00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,690
We already have this, so
all transitions starting from here

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,950
we have already looked at.

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,210
For example, that was just t1.

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,230
That doesn't change when we have
the connection between these two nodes.

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,170
Yeah, so it doesn't change
what would be possible from here.

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:40,880
And then we keep doing that until
at some point no new states are added.

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,710
This case does not
necessarily have to occur.

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:48,020
It can just be, if the reachability graph
is infinite, that this goes on and on.

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,310
That we always find new states.

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,810
But for this concrete Petri net with the

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:59,750
connections given here and
this starting marking it

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,780
results that after finitely many
steps no more markings are added.

00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,070
And new transitions cannot be added either,
if we have considered all of them.

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,860
That is, then that
would be the result graph.

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:27,200
So that's then the reachability graph
for the Petri net given here.

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,510
And this is useful, because
it describes the overall behavior

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,110
of the Petri net in this form.

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,470
This is perhaps not as informative,
from a modeling point of view,

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,930
as this representation here, where we tell from the transitions,
so to speak, what they depend on.

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,740
That can be read
out here at most indirectly.

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,140
You would have to look at all t1

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,230
arrows to find out under
which conditions t1 is fireable.

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,990
But properties of the Petri net
can be examined in this representation.

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,530
In the first lecture on Petri
nets we had asked such questions:

00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:04,460
How can the system reach a dead end?

00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:12,080
And this can't be seen here directly,
whether after some firings it can happen

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,000
that no further transitions are possible.

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,870
However, in this accessibility
graph it is factually obvious.

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,140
We just have to see if there is a

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,960
node from which there are
no outgoing arrows, like this one.

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,920
And then we know:

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,470
Yes, indeed, this Petri net
can reach a dead end.

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,050
The system described by this
can develop in such a

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,630
way that at some point
no further transitions are possible.

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,620
For example, after t1, t3,
t3 we come to a situation

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,930
where no further steps are possible.

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,240
So then we can study properties of
the Petri net on this reachability graph.

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,410
This is true for dead ends.

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,440
This is true
for certain liveness questions.

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,040
The question about dead ends
is ultimately also the question:

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,270
Can the system always live on?

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,290
So we could investigate, for example:

00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,670
Are there infinite processes here?

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,794
So is it possible for the
system to go on and on?

00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:00,797
Yes.

00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:04,640
It can reach an impasse, but if
it behaves favorably, if one makes sensible

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,880
choices, so to speak, as an
external agent (the Petri net itself

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,150
does not specify any
sequence or deterministic choice of

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,130
transitions), there are sequences of
this Petri net that are infinite.

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,290
If one avoids the dead
ends, the system can live infinitely.

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:33,360
And also questions about concurrencies, for example, can
be considered later on the basis of this structure.

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,960
Up to now, we
had only considered this informally.

00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,940
Or questions about capacities.

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,720
One of the questions was:

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,390
Are there any resource upper limits?

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,260
That, for example, if you
consider the tokens as resources,

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,900
there are capacity restrictions.

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,980
And that is indeed what we see here.

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,100
So here we could not
have said immediately whether the

00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,200
total number of tokens in
the system is somehow limited.

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,900
You would have had to think about
what the transitions do to the total

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,260
number of tokens or to the
number of tokens on individual places.

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,780
On the other hand, if we have this
graph, we can look at it and say:

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,750
There is never a
number greater than three.

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,050
That is, we know that
actually in each run of this

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,500
Petri net there are never more
than three tokens on any one place.

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,540
We can look at the graph and see that
when we've built it completely and, of course, correctly.

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,340
Okay, and this kind
of use of reachability graphs

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,390
will be our topic in
the next lecture, not today.

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,470
That will be the topic
of the next video or videos.
