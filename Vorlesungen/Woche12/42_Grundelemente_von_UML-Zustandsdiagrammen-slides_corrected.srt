00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,850
This was our example.

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,770
We would like to implement
this in a state diagram.

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:15,720
And on this I will then
explain the individual basic elements of statecharts.

00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,330
We'll start by
modeling the minute display.

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,500
We have to start somewhere.

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,970
We have hours, minutes, the alarm state.

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,520
Any of these we have to model first.

00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,550
State diagrams allow us, in UML

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,680
terms, to develop just individual components of
the overall state space step by step.

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,020
And we start with the minute
display or actually the minute counter.

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,410
There are 60 minute states: from 0-59.

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,700
And there we can
first imagine that this is

00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,990
still a little bit
like a flat state diagram.

00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,910
But later it will appear
nested in a larger state diagram.

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,840
And then it won't be nested anymore.

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,160
So first of all, just
intuitively, what's the syntax here?

00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,290
One difference to flat statecharts is

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,610
that there are very special
ways to represent the states.

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,780
Here there are these states.

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,090
These would be these
rectangles with rounded edges here.

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,080
These would be the simplest
states that you can have.

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,685
We have a name,
here simply numbered (0-59).

00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:28,050
That should be unique.

00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,170
And in between there are transitions.

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,170
Transitions can be
annotated with a label.

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,015
That's what's called a trigger.

00:01:36,015 --> 00:01:37,425
So we have states.

00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:38,640
We have transitions.

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,000
These arrows, there can be a trigger
on them, that is, a triggering event.

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,350
That can take
different shapes, we'll see.

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,940
And what we have here
specifically is the start state.

00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,710
It looks like this in activity diagrams.

00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,160
This is what in a flat state diagram

00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,070
would just be the incoming
arrow to the start state.

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,590
We start counting at zero.

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,370
Counting up to 59,
each time after 1 minute.

00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,940
Because that's supposed to be the
minute display, and then return to zero.

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,470
And then it goes on and on like that.

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,110
So what are the elements here?

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,530
States, they are these depictions.

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,140
Start state is represented
by this special start node,

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,050
which looks like it
does on activity charts.

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,430
From there there is an arrow
to one of the normal states.

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,520
No edges may lead
into this special element.

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,040
And only one edge may lead out.

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,750
This is different from
the activity diagram, where

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,960
several edges are allowed to
come out of this element.

00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,440
Simple elements.

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,580
Then there can also be an end state.

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,700
This does not appear in the example yet.

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,520
End states are also noted, as in activity

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,770
diagram, with this kind of depiction.

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,460
The flow end does not
exist in correspondence to activity diagrams.

00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,850
But this way to indicate the end state.

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,240
And similar to activity diagram also, no

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,780
edges are allowed to
lead out of these elements.

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,090
Unlike start states, there may
well be multiple end states.

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,470
Such a thing can appear
several times in a state

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,540
diagram, while there can
be only one start state.

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,610
Or later only one
per level or subdivided substate.

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,950
And in fact, this
is what is considered the

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,770
final state here, rather
than the state before it.

00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,720
It can also be, as in our example,
that there are no final states at all.

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,150
This is the case when we
want to model a system that is

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,470
not supposed to terminate at all.

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,540
It should run on and
on and not stop somewhere.

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,370
That is why there
is no final state there.

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,510
Then there is the
notation for these transitions/arrows.

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,310
In the simplest case simply
this connection with an arrow.

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,650
These are also called transitions.

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,620
On the one hand this is a

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,890
bit awkward, because in Petri
nets transitions already have a meaning.

00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,710
But it is the case
that the same term is used.

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,990
And it is not so completely detached or

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,530
completely different from the concept
of transitions in Petri nets.

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,510
It is also about creating
a mediation between two states.

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,810
In the Petri net between two places,
or the transport of marks between places.

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,480
But a transition is simply this arrow.

00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,050
And not some extra node, as
it was the case in Petri nets.

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,430
In general there is
a label on this arrow.

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,270
That's where the trigger can be.

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,630
We have already seen
that, such a triggering event.

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,240
Or simply a label.

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,640
There can also be conditions.

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,290
These can be logical statements.

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,320
A bit like in activity
diagram with the branching nodes.

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,970
And there can be an effect.

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,060
We'll see what's involved there in a
moment, and how we can use that.

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,920
These two parts are optional, though.

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,763
We just had triggers in the example.

00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:23,310
There was this statement:

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,380
"After 1 minute, there should
be a transition at a time."

00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,340
The trigger would be something
like a signal or a message

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,875
that triggers
the corresponding transition.

00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,420
So causing that transition.

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,880
In this case the passing of 1 minute.

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:43,110
At the condition can
be something supervising, a guard.

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:52,780
And it can depend on different properties
of the system, what can occur there.

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,750
We will use Guard less.

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,310
We will use effect, though.

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,070
That is generally something
that triggers this transition.

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,670
We will see later that this
can then trigger transitions in other parts

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,100
of the state diagram, for example.

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,870
In the example so far, the
minutes display, there is only the trigger.

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,490
Simply this specification of a period of
time after which the transition has to trigger.

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:26,590
Later, this trigger can also be
something that was triggered as an

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,550
effect in another part
of the state chart.

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:39,340
We will see this after
a few more observations and slides.

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,200
There will rather be no label
at the arrow from the start

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,860
state, but really only at
the transitions between normal states.

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,970
Not at the start state.

00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,320
At arrows to the final state
there could well be such labeling.

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,320
But primarily we will have that
at the transition between normal simple states.

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:13,130
Then there are actions
or effects that can occur.

00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,200
Not at the transition between
states, but in the states themselves.

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,910
Until now, a state was simply
a box with no other internal shape.

00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,480
In fact, in the UML state diagram,

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,720
actions can be triggered
in the simple states themselves.

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Or activities can be annotated.

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,830
Which should be triggered
respectively when entering, when staying

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,540
in the state, or when leaving.

00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,300
We will use this in a moment
for the beeping in our state diagram.

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,590
In principle, the structure of these is
the same as the labeling of transitions.

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,950
There can be a trigger, there can
be conditions, there can be an effect.

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,820
The trigger here
is something that describes

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,260
at what time this effect should occur.

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,899
Namely exactly this: when
entering, when staying, during leaving.

00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,080
That means the trigger
can take these three forms.

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,260
So the effect, which is written
here, is triggered when entering the state.

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:21,740
An activity should take place while
the system remains in this state.

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,230
Or something should happen when
the system leaves the state.

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,150
Activity is to be understood here
quite in the sense of activity diagrams.

00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,140
This could be, for example, that

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,520
an activity diagram is embedded
in such a state diagram.

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,460
That is supposed to run while
the overall system is in said state.

00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,330
We will not do that.

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,090
We will not use this possibility.

00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,980
But it would be possible in principle.

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,300
We will rather use only simple effects.

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,250
In particular, in our example we said:

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,010
There should be a sound
signal, and always on the hour.

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,440
We can model that, for example,

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
by saying there is
this activity called "beep".

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,800
That's not specified further.

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,050
This is simply an activity
that is perhaps described separately.

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,270
We don't give any further structure here.

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,610
And it should be triggered
whenever the state zero is entered.

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,400
What before was just
this very simple state, rectangle

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,130
with rounded corners, where 0 was inside.

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,300
Now it gets an inner structure.

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,720
This is noted in such a way
that there is still the label zero.

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,050
And also the outer form is
still this rectangle with rounded corners.

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,080
But in the state
inside is still annotated:

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,640
Whenever the state is entered, the
effect/activity sound signal should be triggered.

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,840
I.e. we need a syntax for these states.

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,650
Unlike flat state diagrams, where states
were simply nodes with a name.

00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,870
And nothing else could happen in there.

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,040
That would be the minute display.

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,790
Along with the beeping whenever the
zero state, the 0 minutes are entered.

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,890
What about the hour display?

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,160
For those, of course, we
could do the same thing again.

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,340
Instead of 60 such simple states for the minutes,
there would then be 24 states for the hours.

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,510
Now, of course, we want
this to happen in parallel.

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,950
We want that there is always 1
minute and 1 hour at each time.

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,640
The naive approach would then be to
say we have to form the cross product.

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,940
From the set of all minutes 0-59
and the set of all hours 0-24.

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,680
Then each state would be a
pair of one minute and one hour.

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,420
This is exactly what is also
visible here in such a display.

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,320
Here is finally a pair from a
number of hours and a number of minutes.

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,090
But 24 × 60 that would be already
very many such pairs, which one can form.

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,840
We do not want that.

00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,260
Instead, we want to explicitly express that
minutes and hour display run in parallel.

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,530
That is, the clock is
always in two such states

00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,080
without us actually having
to form these pairs.

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:15,190
Let it be expressed in such a way that the
clock is always in two states at the same time.

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,770
In an hour state and a minute state.

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,560
That didn't exist in
the flat state diagram.

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,360
One way to express that.

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
Here there is.

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,140
And that is modeled
by what are called regions.

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,970
Regions are simply a way
to divide a state diagram

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,000
into at least two (possibly more)
areas that run parallel to each other.

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,470
So that the system is then in
a sub-state in each of these regions.

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,740
Our example will just allow this

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,590
to have 24 hours and 60
minutes of states running in parallel.

00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,250
We would then have to plot 84

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,360
states instead of explicitly making
all pairs between hours and minutes.

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,920
Which would result in over
1000 states by cross product.

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,460
Which is why these
regions are also semantically much

00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,030
more effective than areas
of the activity diagrams.

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:15,870
Where I had said, we draw those
in to get a grouping of actions.

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,760
But beyond that, they
don't have any particular meaning.

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,640
With regions in state diagrams, what
those do is really very effective.

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,840
Namely, that the state diagram is
actually always, in that case, two

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,370
states at the same time.

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,980
In each region in one.

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,320
Because it corresponds to parallelism, it
has rather a bit of the

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,210
character that you get
with activity diagrams by forking.

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,010
These regions are parallel in the sense
that there are no transitions between them.

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,890
If two regions are parallel,
there can be no transitions

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,050
that move from a state of one
region, to a state of the other region.

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,890
I cannot come in the from a minute state

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,710
by some trigger into an hour state.

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,880
What can happen, on the other
hand, is that minutes and hours counters

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,300
progress in parallel at the same time.

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,530
So if a trigger occurs in
both regions, it can also cause state

00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:25,350
changes in both regions in
one step at the same time.

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,610
But there is no
transition between two parallel transitions.

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,130
There can be a transition from one
region to a region not parallel to it.

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,390
So a region shown completely
somewhere else in the state diagram.

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,734
But not between two
or more parallel regions.

00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:51,540
How does this turn
out for our clock example?

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:57,570
How are these regions plotted?

00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:58,880
As follows.

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,980
What we have now is that we
decompose the overall system into two regions.

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,440
That's expressed by this dividing line.

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,280
So we would now have a region
up here and a region down here.

00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,670
And each of these two regions
is its own little state diagram.

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,080
That's where we see at the bottom.

00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,960
What was previously
under entire state diagram,

00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,470
for the minute counter, is now
simply one of the two parallel regions.

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,170
And the other region
looks something like this.

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,550
But has fewer states, because
it's just about the hours.

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,830
Which is only 24, instead of 60.

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,490
We also see that there is now one
start state in each of the two parts.

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,740
There can be a separate
start state in each region.

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,650
In both cases just the zero state.

00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,150
Once for the hours once for the minutes.

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,200
We also see that
names may be reused here.

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,240
That's okay because
they're in different regions.

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,150
So this zero cannot be
confused with this zero, etc.

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:01,020
It's just within a region that a name
is not allowed to appear more than once.

00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,820
And what you also see is that
here, of course, other triggers are assigned.

00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,330
We don't want to change the
hour state after 1 minute as well.

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,130
Instead, we want an hour transition
to occur when trigger h is fired.

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,940
Where does this come from?

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,380
Well, we will discuss that in a moment.

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:22,440
It will be triggered whenever 1
hour is full in the minutes region.

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,930
So at the transition from 59 minutes to
0 minutes again there is 1 hour transition.

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:35,010
Which then simultaneously causes a
progression in the hours count.

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,380
This is a
communication between two regions.

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,390
But not by transitions, so an
arrow that would cross this regions border.

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,880
But by this "remote triggering"

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,920
of an effect, which corresponds to
a trigger in the other region.

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,620
A few more remarks.

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,470
Some of them I had already discussed.

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,450
First, there are two start states.

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,240
There can be at most one per region.

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,440
That's exactly what we've
taken advantage of here.

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,120
We have exactly one in each region.

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,010
That means overall the logical start
state would be 0 hours 0 minutes.

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,260
Time 00:00.

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,090
And hour and minute
indicators do not work independently.

00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,500
Parallel, but not completely independent.

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,940
There is synchronization.

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,870
Namely, exactly when in the minute part

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:37,140
there is a transition to the minute
state zero, this triggers the effect h.

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,150
For hour (hour) this
is supposed to stand.

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,840
This effect h ensures as
a trigger in the parallel regions

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,120
that the hours are counted up.

00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,640
This takes place simultaneously.

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,690
In each region we have this transition.

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,780
This allows us to express here
in a meaningful coupled way what

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,870
it means to have
hours and minutes progress.

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:21,340
That covers part
of our target implementation.

00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:28,570
That ultimately describes
how time evolves.

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,520
Then there's this
aspect of alarm setting.

00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,440
We would like to add to
our state diagram the ability to

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,240
turn off and on that hourly alarm signal.

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,800
So obviously there's like an extra state

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,180
for alarm is on, and an
extra state for alarm is off.

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,430
So where do we put those now?

00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:59,260
We don't want to tinker
those into those regions somehow.

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,920
Then we would
unnecessarily complicate that part

00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,860
of the state diagram
that deals with time.

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:12,160
By also bringing in
this alarm on/off property here.

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,780
We would like to be modular.

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,020
What we have so
far should still be usable.

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:25,120
And separately there should
be this alarm on/off possibility.

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,630
So imaginable we have
alarm on, alarm off.

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,300
Between them there should be triggers.

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,160
By pressing the button
a you should get there.

00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,420
And we should be able to switch between these
two states alarm on or alarm off by pressing b.

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,580
If we look at our stylized
picture of the clock, we see that

00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,230
we would then need quite a
lot of transitions labeled with a.

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,610
Which would have to go out
from all possible hour and minute states.

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,340
If we have 00:00, then it
must be possible to switch a

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,530
to get into the alarm display.

00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,540
If we have 00:01, it
would also have to be possible.

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,050
Factually, for every combination
of hour and minute we

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,390
would have to have a-
transition to go into alarm state.

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,090
That would not be very modular.

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:28,210
Since we wouldn't be able to
achieve that we would only need to

00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,570
extend this state diagram minimally
to bring in this alarm aspect.

00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,390
What can we do instead?

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,070
There is a solution for that in the
UML state diagrams, that there are composite states.

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:50,920
Hierarchies of states where incoming and
outgoing transitions can then be captured.

00:19:50,920 --> 00:20:02,980
Instead of having quite a lot of transitions
by the fact that for each combination of

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:09,040
the one composite state, we have to
have one transition each into another component.

00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,020
It's very abstract now.

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,210
Let's just look at it in the example.

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,740
What we can do:

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,930
We can take what we have so far as our

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,660
time count as one composite state.

00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:34,090
And capture the alarm
aspect in another composite state.

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,830
There is the time display here.

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,130
And that's modeled this way.

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,980
And there's the alarm
display, it's modeled like this.

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,390
There is on and off.

00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,610
You can switch back and
forth between them with b.

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:53,200
And there is the button a, which switches
between the alarm situation and the time display.

00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,410
That then corresponds to being able to
switch between the time and the alarm display.

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:04,210
And b is to switch between
on and off in the alarm display.

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:11,080
The advantage here is, we can just
use what we did for the hour count.

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,710
And describe as a
separate component this alarm component.

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,890
The one on the right,
what was previously our entire

00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,350
state chart, is now
simply a composite state.

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,860
This on the left
is also a composite state.

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,230
This is the alarm display,
which consists of on and off.

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,590
There's a start state
for each everywhere here.

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,950
And there is also a start
state for the whole state diagram.

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:43,410
Initially the time display and not
the alarm display shall be activated.

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,610
These a-transitions shall
not start from sub-states,

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,190
but from the whole composite state here.

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:04,290
This saves us the
otherwise necessary many a-labeled transitions.

00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,390
Which we potentially,
otherwise would need.

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,030
Two more comments.

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,720
First, the states with regions
are of course also composite.

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,050
And this is in the sense
that they are composed of region,

00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,210
rather than
being hierarchically composed.

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,090
A regions state is also composed,

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,290
but in a different way than
this state which is hierarchically composed.

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:35,250
Not by regions, but
simply by having multiple sub-states.

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:44,520
And to distinguish this more clearly,
in what follows I will generally, not

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,700
speak of composite states in general.

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,650
Instead, rather of hierarchical states on the
one hand and regions states on the other.

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,970
Hierarchical states will be something like
what you see here on the left.

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,320
Just any nested states.

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,110
This can also have
multiple levels of nesting.

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,280
Region states will be those
that consist of multiple regions.

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,040
So indicated with such a dashed line.

00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:24,990
And of course the regions themselves
can be composed of several sub-states.
