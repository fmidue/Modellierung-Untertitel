00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,590
Just as there are different ways
of entering the hierarchical or region states,

00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,410
there are also different ways of exiting.

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,670
So we have to take
a look at that as well.

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,450
Let's look at a hierarchical state first,

00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,710
and later at a regions state again.

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,220
In the hierarchical states there is
the exit from the composite state

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,350
as a whole.

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,570
This is, so to speak, the
counterpart to the standard entry, where you

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,535
just approach the overall state from the
outside and don't somehow pick out something inside.

00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:40,620
And in the same way, here would be
the exit from the composite state as a whole,

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,010
without any further indication

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,420
as to which sub-state one would
like to leave the overall state from.

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,910
Then there is the possibility to
exit directly from a specific sub-state.

00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:01,200
This corresponds or would be dual
to the explicit entry into a sub-state.

00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:08,940
And then for entry, there were the two
variants: shallow and deep history.

00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,120
There is nothing corresponding
to those on exit.

00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,100
Yes, on exit, something may be
noted, in order to then, upon re-entry via history,

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,220
access information about where
we were last in this overall state.

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,430
But with the exit arrows themselves,

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,750
there are no additional variants for
history entry, history exit or so.

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,570
So for the hierarchical state, there are
just these two options.

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,630
And what do they mean in each case?

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,300
So, the exit from a
hierarchical state as a whole

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,050
simply means: as soon as the
trigger associated with the transition

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,300
(yes, there could be
a trigger on it here)

00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,470
takes place, the overall state is simply exited.

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,150
No matter in which concrete
sub-state one is at the moment,

00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,370
one simply leaves the overall state.

00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,220
What about when you
exit from a specific sub-state?

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,060
Well then this transition, which probably
has a trigger on it, is

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,400
only selected if you are
actually currently

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,750
in the specific sub-state you
are supposed to exit from.

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:27,920
So in our example diagram, this would be
the state E, because this arrow goes out from E.

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,090
I.e., if there is
a trigger on it and that trigger occurs,

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,760
we can select this transition only
if we are actually currently in E.

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,790
If we are currently in C or
D, then we cannot trigger this exit.

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,280
Besides that, there are other possibilities:

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:55,610
an exit point as well as end states
or terminators over which we can also exit.

00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,271
But these are not treated here.

00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:02,420
So we will only
need these two exit possibilities.

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,740
What this means concretely for
an example would be something like this.

00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,380
So, if we have a state
like this that is composite,

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,590
and we have one
exit from the overall state,

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,750
then in this case, that actually corresponds
to three arrows.

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:36,280
Namely, that we could have explicitly
exited from B, from C, and from D.

00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:44,530
These three exits from specific
sub-states are replaced by a

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,530
single exit from the overall state.

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,400
Because then we don't have to say
where we are in the sub-state right now.

00:03:51,400 --> 00:04:02,440
And this is exactly where we
save arrows in our wristwatch example,

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:10,330
because there we also have just such entries
and exits from or between overall states,

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,890
instead of having arrows for
every combination of sub-state and sub-state.

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,910
That's exactly the goal of
this kind of entry and

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,030
exit: to save
transitions in the representation.

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,800
And here, this very
example corresponds to that.

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,822
This would be when we don't have regions.

00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,700
Now we still have to
look at what happens if

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,260
we have a region state
and we exit from that.

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,930
Then there is also the exit
from the composite state as a whole.

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,460
Then we would just leave,

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,040
no matter what sub-states we are
in right now in the regions.

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,090
There is the exit from
a sub-state, which is now

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,950
just located in one
of the possibly several regions.

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,100
And there is additionally
the exit through a join,

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,930
essentially a counterpart to
the entry through a fork.

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,900
Again, histories are not relevant
here on exit as a representation option.

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,780
Now, what do these exit
possibilities mean for regions states?

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, if we want to exit
again from the state as a

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,530
whole, then this
is simply always possible.

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,510
Then, in each region,
the sub-state present there is simply exited.

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,370
So no matter in which sub-states
we are in the individual regions,

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,150
we can always choose
this exit from the whole.

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:46,010
What about exiting from a
specific sub-state?

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, if we have something like this
situation, then we are only allowed to leave

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,910
the region state if we are actually
at the corresponding state in this region.

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,770
Yes, so we would be allowed to leave the regions state
altogether if we are here in B and here in C.

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,080
Or if we are here in B and here in D.

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,360
But not if we are here in
A and here in C or D.

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,670
So the composite state is left

00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,750
only if one is
actually in the sub-state

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,410
in the corresponding region that this arrow exits from.

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,730
In the regions parallel to it,
one may be in any state.

00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,960
So in this specific case, it is
like this: we would only be able to

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,110
exit if we are actually
in B in the first region.

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,760
That would be this case and this case.

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,390
And in this case, it's explicitly stated

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,440
which sub-state we should
be in per region.

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,590
And accordingly, the rule is as follows.

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,210
We can leave the
composite state via the join

00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:00,000
exactly when we are in the
appropriately labeled state in each region.

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,470
So in the example we could exit only
when we are actually in B and D.

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,420
Not if we are in B and C or something.

00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,320
If we are in B and C,
then we may exit over here,

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,610
and over here, but not over here.
