229 # slide
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,200
Let's move on to
the chapter on statecharts.

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,350
Especially UML statecharts.

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,610
We had already seen flat state diagrams
at the very beginning of the lecture.

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:22,950
And these UML state diagrams
(state machine diagrams/statecharts) are in

00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,040
principle closely related to the flat
state diagrams we have already seen.

00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,160
But in particular they
offer further structuring possibilities, which

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,360
we will get to know in a moment.

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,970
Concerning usage.

00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:45,630
Statecharts are used when the

00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,890
focus of modeling is on
states and transitions between them.

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,800
So a bit away
from what activity diagrams do.

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,440
In a way also the Petri
nets namely to aim at action sequences.

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,870
So putting the actions in the foreground.

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,010
This is more about states and
state transitions of a given system.

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,060
In a way, UML state diagrams are

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,220
rather used when there
is no typical sequence.

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,520
Rather, the focus is on
sequences and events that occur randomly

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,800
or are equally likely
to occur in any order.

00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,210
This is not to say
that there are not systems that

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,250
can usefully be modeled with Petri

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
nets/activity diagrams as well as
flat or UML state diagrams.

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
These are all
possibilities for dynamic modeling.

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,440
And there are certainly examples
where one would have a choice.

00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:44,250
But there are also cases where one
of the two rough directions is more appropriate.

00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:55,380
To distinguish between the two, I would
like to make this observation that activity diagrams

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:03,240
focus on actions and state diagrams
focus on reactions to the environment.

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,300
So a state transition is
triggered by something from outside.

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,660
And then it has to be
described what that does to the states,

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,660
or what new state is
then taken by the system.

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,800
Instead of simply putting sequences
of actions in the center.

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,880
That's very abstract at first.

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,570
Concretely, of course, one
can find various applications.

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,640
I have only mentioned a few.

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,630
State diagrams, whether flat
or UML state diagrams with

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:42,240
additional elements and representation options,
are used in various application domains.

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,400
When describing protocols.

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,900
Components of distributed systems.

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,160
The description of
processes in user interfaces.

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,230
Embedded systems.

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,070
One can certainly continue the list long.

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,500
Because states and transitions have
become a very general framework

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,480
to describe behavior in computer
science, but also in other domains.

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,760
Specifically, the

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,250
state diagrams/statecharts as they later entered
UML date back to the late 80s.

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,605
By a scientist named David Harel.

00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,660
The original name was statecharts.

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,420
That's why you still find that as
the name when you look for examples.

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,550
At the beginning of the
slides, in the first or second

00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,020
week, I had given
an article by Mr. Harel.

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,130
That is the original
paper where statecharts were introduced.

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,510
And with about different
syntax, they later entered UML.

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:50,130
A major goal
of UML statecharts/statecharts is

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,960
what can happen in flat statecharts.

00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,032
Namely, to get a handle on the
fact that the state space grows a lot.

00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,790
There are simply certain features
that statecharts are equipped with.

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,970
In addition to simply
states and state transitions,

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,640
which already existed in flat statecharts,
there are, for example, refinements of states.

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,170
States are not just nodes
in a graph, without internal structure.

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,850
But they can be refined hierarchically.

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:22,020
And that also leads to being
able to handle a state explosion.

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,790
In addition, there is
an explicit concept of parallelism.

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,860
We have already learned
about this in various places.

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,830
In Petri nets/activity diagrams.

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,150
That it's important to be able to express
that; or interesting to be able to model that.

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,800
In statecharts (UML and statecharts)
there is an explicit concept

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,300
here for what is
called parallel switching through regions.

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,730
Which a flat statechart does
not allow to express explicitly.

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,170
And also this will lead
us to model more compactly

00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,990
in UML statecharts
than with flat statecharts.

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,080
A related feature, which
ultimately makes it easier

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,420
or possible to deal with
these two aspects, is history nodes.

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,689
I haven't had much to
say about that yet either.

00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,010
We'll see when we get
that far in the example.

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,180
The main point is to
be able to remember implicitly which

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
states

00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,940
were active last, especially
when leaving such hierarchical/nested/parallel states.

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,350
In order to be able
to resume work later when returning

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,140
to such a hierarchical/parallel connected
area of the state diagram.

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,890
Instead of having to store
this explicitly in the states.

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,151
Then there are so-called
remote triggers, or flags.

00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:51,450
These are simply means to
enable communication in the state diagram.

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:57,570
Even between states that are
not explicitly connected by a transition.

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,960
Many of these features are
mainly used to make diagrams that

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,200
we use clear and compact.

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,680
So to avoid having to
have a lot of states.

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,350
Or if you have many states,
to group them in a meaningful way.

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,080
That the diagram still remains clear.

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,470
So the goal is a size
reduction, versus using a flat state diagram.

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,700
What will not occur here that
we switch between finite and infinite.

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,810
We usually assume flat
statecharts to be finite.

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,670
And even a finite UML state diagram will

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,570
not correspond to an
infinite flat state diagram.

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,350
This is different from Petri nets.

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,490
An infinite Petri net can
have an infinite reachability graph.

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,060
We will not have this
transition from finite to infinite.

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,820
But a similar size reduction or
similar behavior, with respect to size.

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,670
Where even a very small
Petri net can still have a

00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,760
very large reachability graph.

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,560
So it will be similar here.

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,640
There can be very
compact small UML state diagrams,

00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,630
but they would correspond to
very large flat state diagrams.

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,900
We'll do most of the
discussion on a concrete example.

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,558
That's what I'm going to design here now.

00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:29,440
And first describe what the goal is.

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,170
And then after that in other
videos we will gradually realize this

00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,270
example as UML state diagrams.

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,340
I didn't make up the example,
that also comes from Harel's article.

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,400
However, he discussed it in
more detail and with more properties.

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,340
This is a simplified variant of the

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,580
example Harel used
to motivate his statecharts.

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,810
However, this also means that if you like,
you can read about it in the article.

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,890
It is supposed to be about a wristwatch.

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,070
A very simple wristwatch.

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,090
It has a display,
an alarm, and two buttons.

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,540
What should be the intuition here?

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,800
This below is not yet a state diagram.

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm just giving in a stylized

00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,980
way how the wristwatch can
present itself, in certain situations.

00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,600
And will have arrows in between.

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,700
But it won't be a UML state diagram yet.

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,720
Very important!

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,980
So there is this watch.

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,290
It has two buttons, a
and b, left and right.

00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,850
And it has two modes.

00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,150
It can be in
a so-called time display mode.

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,780
Then we have just here
in the display the current time.

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,750
The hour and minute
hand, but digitally displayed.

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,290
Or it can be in an alarm setting.

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,880
You can set an alarm.

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,980
To do that, you first
have to switch to a display

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,050
mode, where you can see if
the alarm is on or off.

00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,770
And then you can turn it on
and off with one of the buttons.

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,180
So switch between the
two on and off situations.

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,250
For switching, this button a is meant.

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,130
So if we're in the time display, we

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,700
can press the button a and
get into the alarm setting display.

00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,670
That is what is
supposed to be shown here.

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,500
And of course we can go back from that.

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,400
So if we are in the alarm setting display

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,310
and we press a again, we
come back to the time setting.

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,840
And we want to
see the current time again.

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,030
The alarm can be on or off.

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,260
That's already shown here.

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,510
Of course, we only see
this when we are in the

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,990
alarm setting display and
not in the time display.

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,520
And then when we're
in this alarm setting display,

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,870
we can use the b button to switch
whether the alarm should be on or off.

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,852
We are in the alarm display
and the alarm is currently on.

00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:57,790
And we press b, then
we're still in the alarm display.

00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,080
But the alarm is off.

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,320
And of course it can be undone.

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,710
So we can also turn the alarm
back on if we just turned it off.

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,610
What is the effect of this alarm?

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,740
It is to make the clock beep.

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,730
It will beep whenever the
time changes to a full hour.

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,140
Of course, we don't see
the beeping sound here now.

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,480
This is just an information,
it will be simply shown in

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,300
the state diagram in a suitable place:

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,180
Beep here in this transition.

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,420
Is it complete in the meantime?

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:34,960
No it isn't.

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,810
Because in fact it's not meant to say
that when we're in the time display and

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,630
we switch to the alarm display,
that then the alarm is always on.

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,000
That would be nonsense.

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,160
Let's imagine that we switch to the
alarm setting, then we turn the alarm off.

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,400
Then we also want to be
able to switch back to the time.

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,620
And not just after we turn the alarm on.

00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,900
So there would still have
to be a transition here.

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,790
Then here, even if we're in the alarm display
and alarm is off, we want to be able to

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,920
switch back to the time display.

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,000
That means the other way around:

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,980
If we wait a few minutes and then press
a again, we don't want to end up here.

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,530
After all, we intentionally
turned off the alarm.

00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,640
We don't want to suddenly find out that
the alarm is on again just because we switched

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,190
to the time display and then wanted
to check whether it was on or off.

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,740
That's not how it's supposed to be.

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,320
Instead, from the time
display, by pressing a,

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,960
we can end up either here or here.

00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,390
And that depends on
whether we turned the alarm

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,250
on or off the last time
we were in the alarm setting.

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,080
And then switched to the time display.

00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,900
That may look non-deterministic here.

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,710
That here you don't know what's
going to happen when you press a.

00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,150
But of course,
implicitly, one already knows.

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,380
Because the clock has a hidden state,
whether the alarm is on or off.

00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,470
So the alarm has
several levels of states.

00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,360
One, what is the current time?

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,020
Is the alarm currently on or off?

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,820
And am I currently showing the
time or the alarm state/alarm setting?

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:18,140
If you think about it now, if
you wanted to model some flat state diagram,

00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,775
you would need quite a lot of states.

00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:24,920
One would have to remember, is one
in the alarm or in the time display?

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,750
Is the alarm on or off?

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,830
What is the current time?

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:33,380
Which consists of a number of
hours between 0 and 23, and

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,180
a number of minutes between 0 and 60.

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,880
So somehow you would get 2
× 2 × 24 × 60 states.

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,070
That is several thousand.

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,780
We do not want that.

00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,140
So we look for
a more compact representation.

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:59,150
And this will be realized in analogy to
the example of Harel via a UML state diagram.

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,940
