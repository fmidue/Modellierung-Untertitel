70 # slide
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,660
Class and object diagrams will keep us
busy this week and also at least next

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,340
week, as the first typical
and most prominent representatives of UML.

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,540
And we'll start this
week with class diagrams.

00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,520
Here's just an example.

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,940
You don't need to be able
to read this right now, of course.

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,885
We'll explain the syntax for it later.

00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:37,140
Here you can see some
details, which we will discuss later.

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,350
There are also some detail deviations from it,
as it will sometimes be in the lecture.

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,900
So the language is not fully formal,
that's why sometimes there are small deviations.

00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,370
For example, we're going to illustrate exactly
the passage here a little bit differently.

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,150
When we make class diagrams ourselves,
we'll usually add types to the

00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,840
attributes that show up here, etc.

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,770
There are various
specifics and small details.

00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,770
But as a first impression, you can

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,750
just take a look at this class diagram.

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,260
So here are kind
of different classes represented.

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,680
Obviously, somehow a university
situation has been modeled.

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,420
Professor, institute, lecture, student.

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,440
There are classes.

00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,550
It could somehow
be the participants occurring

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,020
in a system/program/model that
should be captured here.

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,030
Then there are
apparently some attributes that

00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,130
the individual classes have, so that
objects of those classes (the professor,

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,140
concretely, or a concrete institute)
will have manifestations of those attributes.

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,160
And there are apparently some
relationships represented here as well.

00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,340
There seem to be
different kinds of relations, too.

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,090
Sometimes there are numbers like this
on here, or some very special annotation.

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,310
We're going to do all of that.

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,200
So learning goals for this part
of the lecture here are that on

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,750
the one hand you
learn this modeling language.

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,080
That you can read something like this
and understand why things are annotated differently here.

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
And on the other hand, of course, to

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,890
learn to set up models yourself with it
(little by little, also via the exercise mode).

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:27,310
Okay, now what has to go into
such a class diagram, or what has to

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,750
happen first, before you start
to develop an object-oriented system?

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,150
What should be modeled before that?

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,490
In particular, model statically first.

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,290
Here are a couple of
questions that come up, and

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,330
the answers to them will
ultimately feed into the class diagram.

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,740
So first of all, obviously:

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,710
What objects or classes are needed?

00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,820
So what are the entities?

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,970
In the example,
professor, institute, etc., which

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,750
occur in the scenario and
are therefore to be modeled.

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,350
Also:

00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,300
How many classes are needed?

00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,020
Will one have a class
for each thing that can occur?

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,770
Or is it just about the central
concepts from the domain that one is modeling?

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,660
What are the attributes of these classes
and what are the relationships between them?

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,890
So what should be written as attributes
to which classes, and how are they linked?

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,740
In the example just now, there
were somehow not pairwise relationships between

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,350
all classes via this link
here, but only for selected pairs.

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,020
This must come from somewhere,
must be modeled by something.

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,680
Which operations/methods do
these classes provide?

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,945
That didn't appear at all in the example.

00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:37,570
Those were the empty boxes,
which stood below the classes.

00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,555
Operations would have
to be recorded there.

00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,550
This was not done in the example.

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,470
How do these methods work together?

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,200
That would be more
a question for dynamic modeling.

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,310
In which states can objects be?

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,170
This certainly has something
to do with attributes.

00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,260
Which messages are sent
to other objects and when?

00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,080
Which messages there are,
that would be static.

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,040
When exactly that happens would again
be a question for dynamic modeling,

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,630
which we can only answer later
and not with class and object diagrams.

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,120
Some of these points already
have appeal to dynamic modeling.

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,250
But already for this static modeling, if

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,640
you answer the first few questions
here, you have to get going somehow.

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,090
There are various approaches
to this in the literature.

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,020
They are not
completely formal or systematic.

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,820
For example, the first thing is
to somehow record requirements for a domain.

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,520
Requirements gathering.

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,550
The first step would
be to determine the classes.

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,410
Later, you can try to
establish relationships between the classes in

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,580
order to ultimately work
towards the class diagram.

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,380
What I would like to do now in
the next slides is to simply pick an example

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,760
from one of the books that
I presented at the beginning of

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,910
the lecture in the first week and
at least simulate this finding of classes.

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,830
This won't be
completely systematic, but at

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,130
least it gives you an
idea of how to proceed.

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,370
Even if you have such a task
in the exercises that you are given

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,360
a scenario and you are
supposed to identify the classes (and

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,080
later also the properties
and relationships between them).

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,780
We'll do that with the following example.

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,930
This is in English because, as I
said, it's taken from one of the books,

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,950
and that was the English language book.

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,240
We will discuss it a bit superficially
here, and we will not fill in

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,160
all the class diagram elements.

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,750
But you should get an impression
and you should be able to copy

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,280
it when you get such an exercise.

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,330
Let's assume that a library is
to be modeled in some way.

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,550
And in advance, some
use cases were recorded.

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,520
In other words, we wrote down what the system
to be designed is supposed to do in the end.

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,670
And one of these use cases would be

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,790
to register a new member in the library.

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,580
And that was written
down here in tabular form.

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:21,230
In each case, what a user
would like to do with the

00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,920
system from an external black box perspective,
so to speak, what actions are executed.

00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,870
And then it says in each case
how the system should react to that.

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,380
Here:

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:37,670
A customer fills out a form with name,

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,950
address and phone number, and
gives that to the employee.

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:45,785
The clerk, or the employee, asks
the system to create a new member.

00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:49,220
The system responds by
asking for more information.

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,540
This information is entered.

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,760
The system reads the data
and creates a new member entry.

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,670
Gives it a
unique identification number, etc.

00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,570
All this was written down verbally.

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,210
And now the first question
would be, in the design:

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,730
What would have to be the classes
that you want to hold on to?

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,460
What are somehow types of recurring objects
here, of objects to be captured together,

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,540
that play a role in
describing the state of the system?

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,320
Of course, that would be
just one of many use cases.

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,700
There would be others to add
new books, check out books, return a

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:36,350
book, perhaps remove books from the
catalog, create user account statements, etc.

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,940
What might one learn from this about the
possible classes one might want to capture here?

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,280
Well, a very naive approach
would be to simply look:

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,140
What terms are in here?

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,950
And the obvious approach would
be to look at nouns/nouns first.

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,840
Because classes are things.

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Not verbs, but subjects
and objects of these sentences.

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,860
And that sounds very naive,
but it's actually a first

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,550
step you can take
to find candidates for classes.

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,420
And if we just do that here,
pick out all the nouns in this English

00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,880
text, here are all of them in bold.

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,470
And that's quite a lot.

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,370
You certainly don't want to have that
many classes in the system in the end.

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,170
Not all of them
will actually become a class.

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,470
You can now take these terms
and filter or group them and

00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,340
find out which of them
should actually be a class.

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,650
What you have to
record in your class diagram.

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,480
And there you can
first make some observations.

00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,670
For example, it's noticeable that
there are certain entities here that

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,980
seem to form composite entities.

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:57,490
So for those it makes direct sense to
encapsulate them as a class that has different attributes.

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:04,960
This is the case for
members or customers, for example.

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,700
Because here it says something like this:

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,670
Customer has a name, an
address and a phone number.

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,420
These are apparently
attributes of this customer.

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:23,350
And customer is already such a
term, "the customer" is already very domain-specific.

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,610
You could also say more generally:

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,390
It's about a member.

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,930
If you look:

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,040
What are composite entities?

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,420
There are at least two, namely:

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,510
The member seems to be composite because
there is supposed to be an identification

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,220
number in the system
and certain other information.

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,650
And the system itself
also seems to be composite

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,410
because it contains,
for example, the members.

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,340
What were other nouns that occurred here?

00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,460
Customer, I had already said,
is the same as a member.

00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,990
You could look for synonyms and say:

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,580
Customer and Member are synonyms.

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,060
Only for one of them
you will have to introduce a

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,490
class, the other one will
just be another name for it.

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,595
What other nouns were there?

00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:10,990
User.

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,910
But that's also just another synonym.

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:18,820
User, Customer, Member, all refers to
the same actors in the system.

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,060
So no new classes, but Customer and
User will also be the class Member later.

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,370
Application-Form, that is actually here
only a sheet of paper,

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,490
on which the customer enters
his data at the beginning.

00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,280
So nothing that is
represented in the system itself.

00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,210
The data later is.

00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,680
But this application, this
form, which is filled

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,650
out, is nothing that
occurs in the system itself.

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,090
So you could say:

00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,780
That's not an indication that it
has to be introduced as a class.

00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,110
Then there is the request.

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:04,800
That was something that
the employee should trigger

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,150
(like by selecting a menu,
an entry in the system).

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,440
So like application form rather
not part of a data structure.

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,260
So nothing that needs
to be stored explicitly somehow.

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,460
Then there was the
customer name, address, phone number.

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,170
I had already motivated that earlier:

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,250
On the one hand, these are attributes of
Member, and on the other hand, they are

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,440
also indications that Member
should be a class.

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
We had talked about encapsulation.

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,280
So the composition of single entities always speaks
for the fact that they should be classes.

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,720
On the other hand, such single terms as the
name, which is not further decomposed apart from first and

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,110
last name, speak for the fact that
they are perhaps rather attributes of other classes.

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,820
And there must not necessarily be an own
class for the name or the phone number.

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,640
That is, these would be attributes that

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,320
we would assign (in the
class diagram) to the Member class.

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,710
The Clerk is of course an actor, but
has here only the role to serve the system.

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,280
He would not himself
be represented in the software.

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,120
Except perhaps:

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,690
The Clerk also needs to
be stored with his contact

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,380
information, perhaps to
manage the library's employees.

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,220
When it comes to the library
itself, the "business", borrowing books, etc., the

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,120
Clerk himself is not something
that needs to be stored.

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,310
What else is there?

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,870
Identification-Number is also
part of Member, so

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:47,830
would be an attribute of the Member
class, like those three terms at the end.

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,280
What else shows up there?

00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:57,370
Data and Information, these are simply also
the things that are stored as members.

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:03,670
Data and Information were simply collective
terms for these attributes, not new classes.

00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:16,870
Okay, that as such not a
complete recipe, but a certain intuitive

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:23,770
approach to first identify from free
text what can be classes and attributes.

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,970
The next step would be then to
derive between these classes, which one identified (the

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:37,270
system and the member term),
any relations, in order to

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,090
be able to hold in
the class diagram also relations.

00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:46,120
To do that, we have to go
back to the text and look for descriptions

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,750
that somehow relate two classes, specifically member
and system, or somehow mention them together.

00:13:52,750 --> 00:14:01,540
And when we do that, we find, for example,
the following sentence in the context of a larger point:

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,270
The system remembers
information about the member.

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,150
Information, that's the
attributes of Member.

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,770
And Member would be a class,
of which there are then different instances:

00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,140
the concrete individual
members of the library.

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,170
How could we represent that, somehow a
relationship between the system and the members?

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,540
Let's call the system Library, so that we
don't call it just System in the abstract.

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,470
It's about the library.

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,010
So the system could be
a class, the library class.

00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,920
And then there is the class Member.

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,800
There are already some attributes in

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,480
there that we indexed on
the pre-slide as properties of members.

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,065
And then there could be
a relationship between the two.

00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:49,240
And there are already numbers written on

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,400
here that imply (and it will be formulated
later what exactly they mean), as a basic idea:

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,200
There is a library and it
has several members, "zero to star".

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,290
Where star means: any number of members.

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,730
Up to no members at all at the
beginning, when the library might be newly founded.

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,720
The library exists only once.

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,060
One could also ask whether this
must be a class or whether

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,610
it is sufficient to
have an object for it.

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,110
There is the notion of a singleton class.

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,410
Again, these are patterns that would
come into play in the advanced

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,070
programming techniques
lecture, for example.

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,760
But here, it's already conveyed a little
bit by the numbers and the information

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,310
about how many objects there
can be of the singleton classes.

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,010
In particular, how many
are in such a relationship.

00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:40,630
The library manages
a collection of members,

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,580
and here it says how many that can be.

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,880
Of course, types would also
belong to the attributes here.

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:49,630
There we have here:

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:55,135
This is a number, this is an
address, here maybe just a string, etc.

00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,360
That is not yet exactly
fixed on this level of the

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,730
class diagram, but would be also
task of the class diagram designer.

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,110
This is not very far yet, this picture.

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,070
Now one could add further use
cases, for example the creation of members.

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,250
Or in addition to the creation
of members, the creation of books.

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,350
The lending of books, etc.

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,900
This could lead to further
classes, but especially to further relationships.

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:29,380
Now here is simply shown, also
from the book, how after some consideration

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,880
of further such use cases
the picture might be refined.

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,690
For example, that in
addition to managing members, the

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,550
library also has a
collection of books to manage.

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,440
That's why there is a new class

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,200
Book, and then there are
also relationships between members and books.

00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,870
For example, borrowing, that is, the
fact that a borrowing has taken place.

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,910
Or maybe that if a
book is not available, but

00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,400
a member wants to borrow it,
you can then somehow create a reservation

00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,250
that holds a reservation on that book.

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,770
So that when the book
becomes available, you can borrow it.

00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,390
That would be a next
step in designing a class diagram.

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,350
And that's where you
can do further refinement.

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,510
So these relationships here,
they would just be strokes.

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,420
We're going to learn
that there are different types

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,060
of relationships that each
have their own meaning.

00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,680
And if you analyze this here in
more detail, what nature these individual relationships

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,020
are, you could come to
the following picture, for example.

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,370
Where, on the one hand, one has
introduced more classes here, namely an explicit

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,550
membership catalog and a book catalog.

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,820
But above all, here the connections
have been refined, made more precise.

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,920
There are different types of symbols.

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,580
We'll look at all of that, what
that's supposed to mean in each case.

00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,300
But the point is:

00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:05,340
People have continued to refine the picture
here to ultimately get closer to implementation.

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,400
Each step adds information that is
motivated from the application domain, and

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,070
should later help with
the implementation of the system.

00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,480
Here are different names for the connections
and also different ways of representing them.

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,950
Here, for example, it was decided
that what was here before as a

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,930
class for the borrowing
process is not strictly necessary.

00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,230
Because you can also store the information
with the book or with the member.

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,375
While the reservation is something that should be
explicitly represented as a class, because there is

00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:45,510
still external information necessary, for example
until when the book should remain reserved.

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,780
That as a first example
with not much detailed information yet,

00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,030
but at least an impression how
such a class diagram should look like.

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:10,710
Okay, next we really
have to introduce syntax.

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,690
How exactly such a
class is to be notated.

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,540
There is a lot left vague here.

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,660
But I'll do that in another video.
