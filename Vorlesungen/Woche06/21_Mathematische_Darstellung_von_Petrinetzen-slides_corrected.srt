00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,430
After the informal examples,
let's discuss the formal definition

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,190
of Petri nets this week.

00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:13,560
Now this looks like
a complicated definition at first.

00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,010
But it simply uses set-theoretic

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,000
terms that I repeated
in a video last week.

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,330
Or that you should already
know from somewhere else, maybe

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,330
also from recent mathematics lectures.

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,960
So here is mathematically stated:

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,300
A Petri net from now on, if we
want to represent it formally/mathematically (and ultimately the

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,180
syntax of the Petri net independent of
the graphical representation), is defined like this.

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,550
As a 5-tuple.

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,920
Five components play into this.

00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,720
We have a finite,
non-empty set of places.

00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,160
Non-empty because a Petri net
without places would make no sense.

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,760
And finite, because we are
only considering finite Petri nets.

00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,140
Although I have said that the behavior

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,885
described by this
could still be infinite.

00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:06,540
So a corresponding flat state
diagram could be infinite, even

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,550
though the Petri net
has only finitely many places.

00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,060
This is because, as we have already
seen in an example in an earlier video,

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,960
it could be that an arbitrary
number of tokens accumulate on a site.

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,600
So then the total number of
all possible state configurations is quite

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,840
infinite, because of these arbitrarily
many tokens on one place,

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,270
even though the Petri net itself has
finitely many places and finitely many transitions.

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,130
So S is such a
set (finite, nonempty) of places.

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,570
Analogously, a set T (also
finite, and also non-empty) of transitions.

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,520
In the graphical representation, these are
the empty, large circles and rectangles.

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,350
So that's part
of the structural information.

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,990
Of course, we need to
know more, namely about the arrows/connections.

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,350
They are represented here in the
mathematical definition by two such functions.

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,340
These are in each
case functions from the set

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,710
of places to the
natural numbers including the zero.

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,130
And such two functions
exist for each transition t.

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,390
So for each transition t, each element of
this set T, there are two such functions.

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,620
And they're called this here:

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,920
Bullet, filled circle, before
t and after t.

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,730
But these are just names,
just a short notation for them.

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,990
We actually want to express the precondition
weights of t and postcondition weights of t.

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,380
We want to do this
for each transition and each place.

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,550
We take a transition t
and specify a function that

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,180
assigns a natural number to each place.

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,810
Namely, this specifies how many
tokens are taken out of each

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,350
place by this transition t.

00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,740
Or, if we consider
this function, then how many

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,680
tokens are put on a given
place by the corresponding transition t.

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,190
Since a value is
given here for each place.

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,780
Because this is a function from the set
of places into the set of natural numbers.

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,700
Thus always all places are considered.

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,060
For really every place a value is given.

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,320
That is the concept of the function.

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,670
But we can also have zero
as a result for a certain place.

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,640
Then there is another such function.

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,490
Again, a function of
places into the natural numbers.

00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,990
And that is the initial marking.

00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,090
This has per se nothing
to do with the transitions, but

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,360
describes how in the initial situation of
the Petri net the tokens are distributed.

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,330
Therefore, besides the sets S and T and
these families of functions (which specify such a

00:03:51,330 --> 00:04:00,600
function for each t out of T),
there is another distinguished function here, namely m0.

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,010
This is the initial
marking or start marking.

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,670
And, as I said before:

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,370
Such an expression, that is,
one of these bullet t

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,780
or t-bullet functions, evaluated for a
particular location s, is called a weight.

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,860
Or pre-weight in that case,
post-weight in the other case.

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,720
These functions of this shape S
to N, which occur here several

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,120
times, are also
generally called "markings".

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,770
Here it already appears as
a term in the name.

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,400
But also these functions
can be understood as markings.

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,700
We will need this term, so
I will define it again separately.

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,270
So a marking is simply
a function of this form.

00:04:53,270 --> 00:05:01,760
And it can indicate how many
tokens are currently in individual places.

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,910
That would be the application here,
to indicate the initial or initial marking.

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,440
But such a function can just
also be used to indicate how

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,600
many tokens are to
be taken from individual places.

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,220
This was the case for the pre-weight.

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,860
Or how many tokens are
to be added to individual places.

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,870
That would be the
case for the post-weighting.

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,310
And, of course, it's important to note that there
can be variance in each of the three cases.

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,820
So it can be assigned here, in
a marking, a different value for each place.

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,920
Now we won't always necessarily write
these functions down as functions, that

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,690
is, with an assignment rule.

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,680
If S is small, for example
contains only 3 or 4 elements,

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,050
we actually want to
specify only three values.

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,840
Then we will often write
them in tuple notation again.

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,680
So in particular, if we have places s_1
through s_n, for a not-too-large n, and we've decided

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,860
on an order (perhaps
numbering the places from

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,390
s_1 to, say, s_4), then we
can also express/write such a function by

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:12,080
simply writing down the results of m,
from that function, for s_1 through s_n.

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,510
We'll see that in an example in a
moment, in case this seems obscure to you.

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,690
And of course:

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,960
This mathematical notation, using this
term, will ultimately have to

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,810
be brought into agreement with
the graphical representation, of course.

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,090
We've already seen the graphical representation, with
the places and rectangles and so on.

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,290
There will be the relation
that the places from the mathematical

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,796
definition also correspond to the places
, the circles, in the graphic representation.

00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:47,590
And the transitions
from the mathematical definition,

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,370
the elements of T, will
be represented as rectangles or squares.

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,790
The tokens, that is, what
is described by the initial

00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:02,980
marking, are represented as filled small
circles lying on the large circles.

00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,680
Edges between places and
transitions are represented with arrows.

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,720
This is the information that lies in
the mathematical representation in the weight functions.

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,310
And a key point that makes
the graphical representation perhaps more intuitive

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:27,628
than the mathematical representation is that in
special cases we can save information for

00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:30,610
the weight functions in the
graphical representation, or leave it implicit.

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,280
So we won't draw arrows
in the graphical representation if

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,710
the weight functions say,

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,150
for example, that a connection from a
place to a transition has weight 0.

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,590
Then the edge will be omitted altogether.

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,230
And if a weight is
1, we will just draw an

00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,570
arrow, but not give it a value.

00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,490
In the example from the last
video, on the other hand, where we

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,060
once wrote a 2 to an arrow
or did so in two places, this

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,720
would correspond to cases where such a function would
also sometimes have a value 2 as a result.

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,600
So we have to
interpret the graphical representation

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,120
relative to
the mathematical representation.

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
I will now do
this directly with an example.

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,050
Let's take this
graphically represented Petri net.

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,620
This obviously has
three places, three transitions,

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,230
and at the beginning the
tokens are distributed as shown here.

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,940
And there's an arrow that

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,470
generates two tokens as in the last
video when the transition t1 is fired.

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,210
That would be
the graphical representation.

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,580
In order to write down a mathematical

00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,400
representation, we have to
decide on a place order.

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,690
Here it is obvious to give the
places just in the order s1, s2, s3.

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,010
We will need this if we
want to describe the markings as tuples.

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,070
Mathematically, we would have here
a three-element set of places,

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,260
a three-element set of transitions, and

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:16,030
the arrow representation can be written down,
for example, for t1 as follows.

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,860
What do we know about
this transition from the graphical representation?

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,100
We know that it consumes
a token from s1, consumes

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:31,690
a token from s2, and puts two tokens into
s3, but does not take a token from s3.

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,550
The precondition function says:

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,360
One token from s1, one token
from s2, and zero tokens from s3.

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,760
This corresponds to the non-existent
arrow from here to here.

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,110
And the fact that
t1 deposits something exactly in

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,420
s3, two tokens, is expressed here.

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,790
Nothing is deposited in s1 because
there is no back arrow here.

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,730
Nothing is placed in s2 because
there is no back arrow here either.

00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,890
Two tokens are stored in s3.

00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,350
This information, in these
two lines, corresponds to

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:12,970
the information given here by the
corresponding arrows and the labels around t1.

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,840
The same would be done for t2
and t3, thus writing down corresponding additional lines.

00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,770
For the initial marking, that is, for
the distribution of tokens in the initial image,

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,410
we have this start
marking or initial marking.

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:29,920
It says:

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,280
On s1 there has to
be one token on s2 there

00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,030
have to be two tokens and s3
has to be empty at the beginning.

00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,340
If we decide on an order of the

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,200
places (s1, s2, s3 for example), then
we can write this information more compactly.

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,100
For example, we simply write down
the precondition function for t1 in the

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,700
form that we form a triple from
the three results for s1, s2, s3.

00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,440
For this we just need to know this order.

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,680
So if we were to write them down the

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,420
other way around, we might
have to put the zero here.

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,270
But for s1, s2, s3, we have 1,
1, 0 here and 0, 0, 2 here.

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,610
Of course, we can do the same thing for

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,480
the initial marking and
specify that this way.

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:27,580
And if we do that for t2, t3
as well, we would have a mathematical representation

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,180
exactly corresponding to the graphical representation,
which we can just work with mathematically.

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,020
We will want to specify Petri nets
sometimes this way and sometimes that way.

00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,550
Depending on the intended use,
we may want to define

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,490
something more mathematically, perform analysis
for the Petri nets, for example.

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,980
Or do we want to illustrate or

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,730
simulate rather, or intuitively go through
and discuss what transitions are possible?

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,810
Then we can work
more with the graphical representation.

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,630
But you must know both representations
and also be able to relate them.
