00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,590
So let's consider a first concrete Petri

00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,930
net, in its graphical representation.

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,800
We will get to
know a mathematical representation later.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,030
But we'll introduce this informally
first about the graphical representation.

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,990
And in particular, this video will be
about introducing the notion of firing as well.

00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,510
So what do we have here?

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,180
A Petri net represented with these two

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,590
types of ultimately nodes
and their connections between them.

00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,310
I had already briefly mentioned on a

00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,650
previous slide that these
circles are called places.

00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,510
And they're thought of as
sort of storage places for resources.

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,710
Where resources could be quite different things
depending on the system that's being modeled.

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,560
So simply the input data for a process

00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,000
or actually material resources like
the snacks in a snack machine.

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,030
Or simply logical
preconditions for individual actions.

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,330
Input signals/things that might
somehow be relevant as

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,750
preconditions for actions in the
system or processes in the system.

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,160
So these are these circles that
are initially thought to be empty.

00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,350
And then in these circles, on
these storage places, so-called tokens can lie.

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,000
These are also called tokens.

00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,570
These small filled circles, which could
lie on the previously still empty

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,640
larger circles, these
would be the resources.

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,040
So the places are places for resources,

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,820
and then these small
filled circles are concrete resources.

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,690
And there could be several of
them on one place, or none.

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,840
Now here is one token
on each of these two places.

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,090
There are no tokens
on the other three places.

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,060
This can also be different.

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,410
There could be several tokens lying here.

00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,380
Or there could be tokens everywhere, or there
could be no tokens anywhere, as in this case.

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,670
That makes then in
each case a system state.

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,670
So whether there are no tokens at all
on these five places or one token each,

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,680
or two tokens up here
and three tokens down here,

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,440
that makes up a
system state in its entirety.

00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,660
If we think back to the flat state

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,480
diagrams, then we had the individual
states, which were then connected with arrows.

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,630
And basically one state in such
a flat state diagram would correspond to

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,170
an overall configuration, one way

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,360
in which the locations of such a Petri
net may or may not be assigned to tokens.

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,690
And then there's this other kind
of nodes in this Petri net graph.

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,640
These are the rectangles here.

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,470
Sometimes I'll draw them as squares.

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,000
Anyway, with corners and not as circles.

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,270
And these are
the so-called (system) transitions.

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,850
So the idea then is that by the
arrows going in or out to these rectangles,

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:57,220
it shows under what circumstances one
overall state can transition to another.

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,690
We will discuss this in a
moment, what for example to this transition

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,190
the incoming/outgoing
arrows mean concretely.

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:09,490
And that will be that they somehow cause
the tokens to be located somewhere else afterwards.

00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,260
So the structure of the Petri net remains

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,100
the same, the places/transitions remain the same,
but the tokens can be in other places.

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,580
Then we have a new overall state
of the Petri net as a whole.

00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,230
And the transitions describe, record how
to get from one state to another.

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,310
And that is, so to speak,
recorded locally at a position in

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,050
a controlled way for each transition.

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,420
This is again different from flat
state diagrams, where you can't necessarily

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,780
read/recognize the preconditions for individual
actions concentrated at one position.

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,720
Okay, so this notion of transition and

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
in/out arrows is obviously very central.

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,420
So let's shed some more light on this.

00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,540
A transition in general
is just such a rectangle.

00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,390
That can be connected to several
of the places/circles, by incoming/outgoing arrows.

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,607
And it can be quite different.

00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:07,570
There could be no incoming arrows at
all, or more than two, or only one.

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,500
So it is completely free.

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,590
It depends on the concrete Petri
net we are dealing with and

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,960
the places that lie
before the corresponding transition.

00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,980
So they are not graphically in front of it, but
they are in front of it with respect to the arrows.

00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,410
They do not necessarily have to
be shown above as in the example.

00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,550
They could also lie somewhere else.

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,630
But the point is, those places that
have an incoming arrow into a transition are

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,970
called preconditions of that transition.

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:40,080
So those are places where tokens should be
located that will be consumed by the transition.

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,200
There on the left
are these incoming arrows.

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,270
And all places that are
located after a specific transition

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,490
are called postconditions
of this transition.

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,080
So these are places into
which tokens can be generated.

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,640
And the transitions are
the actual information carriers.

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,070
There it is recorded:

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,260
How do the tokens change?

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,620
So the transitions together with their
pre- and post-conditions are the central

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,550
information carriers in the
representation of a Petri net.

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,790
So it could be for example like this:

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,040
Here are two tokens on these two
places and then this transition could fire.

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,960
And that would cause those two tokens
to be consumed and new tokens to

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,420
be created on
the three postcondition sites.

00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,710
So that's not like a token
could move through here or that

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,600
could happen independently
for the two inputs.

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,000
But rather both inputs are consumed at the
same time and a token is deposited on

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,900
all three outputs, in this specific case
of a transition designed in this way.

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,990
Of course, if the constellation
is different, then it is analogous.

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,300
And exactly this change, the removal of
the tokens of the precondition and then

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,340
simultaneous generation of the tokens in the
postcondition, is called firing of this one transition.

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,170
And of course, if there
are many transitions in the Petri

00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,630
net, then this can
happen at different places.

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,820
And it depends in each
case on the pre- and post-conditions

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,280
what exactly this does to a system state.

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,535
This can be more general
than here in the example.

00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:19,470
Here, by chance, it looked like
that, for example, there was exactly

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,130
one token here and afterwards
exactly one token in the postconditions.

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,550
There could also have been
more than one token here before.

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,770
So here could have been
two tokens and one token.

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,127
Then one of these two would be
removed and the one that was here.

00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:36,960
In general, there can
be more than one token.

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,260
It is also possible to consume
more than one token per arrow.

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,020
Then you have to note that on the arrow.

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,510
We will discuss how

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,800
this is displayed exactly and what
effects this has on the firing.

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,220
It could also be that there are no incoming
arrows at all or no outgoing arrows at all.

00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,970
This is then called either
sources or sinks, such transitions.

00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,580
We will get to know that concretely, too.

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:09,300
And unlike in this very simple example,
it doesn't have to be the case

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,510
that there are empty
places for the post-condition places.

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,580
Tokens could have
already been placed here.

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,957
Then some more would be
added by firing this transition.

00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:24,570
So very general
constellations are conceivable.

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,200
Neither must everything have
been empty here before,

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,900
nor must everything be
empty up here after firing.

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,030
So if for example two tokens
would have been here, and the transition

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,685
demands just one token from this place, then
afterwards just one token would have been here.

00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:46,500
So all this is possible.

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
We can go through this again
with the example from the slide before,

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,850
for some concrete situations.

00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,890
For example, let's take this initial
situation as it was on the slide.

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,550
Then we can ask ourselves:

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,800
Where could we fire here at all?

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,580
Which of the four
transitions could be fired?

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:19,260
And well, it must always be the
case that the tokens are actually present

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,980
in the places from
which tokens are requested.

00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,270
So for example this transition here
on the left could not be fired

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,610
in the current system state.

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:29,970
Why?

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,390
Because it would request
a token from this place.

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,770
But there are no tokens there.

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,580
This place is empty.

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,140
Then this transition can't fire.

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,060
And the same would be
true for this and this transition.

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:49,050
On the other hand, this
transition here could actually fire.

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,410
Why?

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,690
Because for all incoming arrows of
this transition there is actually a token.

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,000
So this transition would fire.

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,450
And that would mean that the token would disappear
and a token would be added here and here.

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,200
Okay, that was also the only
possible step in the case just now.

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,735
So and then it could go on.

00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:12,090
Now we have a
new constellation of the Petri

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,720
net, i.e. a new assignment
of the places with tokens.

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,740
And then we could ask ourselves again:

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,030
What is possible now?

00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,570
So obviously this transition
can't directly fire again now.

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,750
Because it has now no more tokens in its

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,370
precondition, which would allow firing.

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,320
But for example this
transition could fire now.

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,340
Because it now has a
token on the only precondition place.

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,190
So this transition could fire
now, it is activated now.

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,880
It's ready to fire now.

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,940
Okay, and if we just do
that, now this token would disappear because

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,660
it's consumed by the transition, and
a token would be created here.

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,610
That is, the next state would be this.

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,360
And then you can
think about other processes.

00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,050
What could happen now?

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:01,350
For example, now this transition could
fire because it is activated by this.

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,080
We could also have imagined that

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,955
this transition would fire at first
and maybe the other one later.

00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:13,770
But we just happened to decide that
we would do it in that order.

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,050
But there is a
certain non-determinism, that is,

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,930
the order is not necessarily fixed
and determined as only one possible sequence.

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,020
That's called non-determinism.

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,770
In the case here, I have
now reached the initial position again.

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,220
Now, if I want to continue, I
would have to fire this transition again.

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,830
Because we had already discussed that
nothing else works in this situation.

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,910
So I fire this again and
maybe I decide now next time not

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,980
to necessarily have
the same sequence again.

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,720
So to fire that and to fire that.

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,510
Maybe now I decide to fire here.

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,810
I may do that because I can
always execute one of the possible activated transitions.

00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,130
And this transition is
also activated because it has

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,310
exactly one precondition place and
there is a token there.

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,690
So we could then consume the
token from here, redeposit it here.

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,540
Well, what else would
be possible after that?

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,210
Now only this
transition would be fireable.

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,050
This is the only transition
that actually still finds enough tokens

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,140
on its precondition places,
in this case one.

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:23,300
So we could fire like this
and then it doesn't go any further.

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:36,620
We can't do another step here, because
none of the transitions here are activated.

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,380
That means, in that case, we would
now have maneuvered ourselves into a dead end.

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,470
I had already said that, that
is a general term for Petri nets:

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,460
The Deadlock.

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,230
Now we would have reached a deadlock.

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,380
Because at a point before that,
we decided non-deterministically to execute this

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,210
transition, which ultimately takes a resource
out of the system, so to speak.

00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,930
From down here, that
token never gets anywhere else.

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:02,330
And the only possible progress left would

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,220
be to execute this
transition again at some point.

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,460
But it won't come to fruition if
it can never find a token here.

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,930
Then we would have reached
a deadlock in that case now.

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,430
The system is not deadlock-free.

00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,720
And that was basically because we
made an unfavorable choice at that

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,530
point to execute that transition.

00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,000
It's not like that
was the only possible choice.

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,510
If we look closely here,
particularly with respect to this point,

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,490
there is a possible
conflict in the Petri net.

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,500
Because here this lower transition would have been
activated as well as this above one, but of

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,630
course not both at the same time.

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,070
So they can't both get their way.

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,240
Because this transition wants a token from
here, this transition wants a token from here.

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,330
So these two transitions are in
conflict with respect to this resource.

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,570
And, if we unfortunately decided
in the example to give

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:57,260
preference to the lower transition, that
is, to pass on the token,

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,020
then we have ultimately maneuvered
the system into a dead end.

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:09,160
And these are precisely questions that
can then be investigated for Petri nets.

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,640
Are there conflicts like that?

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,120
Is there this kind of
non-determinism where we have to decide?

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,590
When do we have these kinds of
conflicts? What are the consequences of that?

00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,780
Can we get into situations, say,

00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,100
where the system is then dead
because no further steps are possible?

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,640
Or can we perhaps always avoid
this happening for a concrete system?

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,970
These are general questions that
we can answer for Petri nets.

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,070
Here it was only a matter
of introducing firing as a concept.
