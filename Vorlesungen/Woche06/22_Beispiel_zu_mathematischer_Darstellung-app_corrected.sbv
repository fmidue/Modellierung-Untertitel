0:00:00.000,0:00:05.115
Let's do one more example.

0:00:05.115,0:00:06.660
One last video for this week.

0:00:06.660,0:00:09.810
An example of this connection
between mathematical

0:00:09.810,0:00:13.380
and graphical representation
of Petri nets.

0:00:13.380,0:00:21.150
I had just briefly outlined on the
slide the way that we have a Petri net

0:00:21.150,0:00:24.240
in graphical representation and we read
the mathematical representation from that.

0:00:24.240,0:00:26.940
Of course, you have to be able
to do that the other way around.

0:00:26.940,0:00:33.180
So here is an old exercise where the
mathematical representation of a Petri net was

0:00:33.180,0:00:38.880
given, and the question was asked for the
corresponding graphically represented Petri net.

0:00:38.880,0:00:45.150
And I would now simply develop this with you
briefly here, i.e., demonstrate it to you.

0:00:45.150,0:00:47.820
So, what do we have?

0:00:47.820,0:00:51.120
We have given information about the

0:00:51.120,0:00:55.290
number and ultimately identity
of places and transitions.

0:00:55.290,0:00:56.310
So, what we see here is:

0:00:56.310,0:01:01.350
There are three places s1, s2, s3
and four transitions t1, t2, t3, t4.

0:01:01.350,0:01:05.820
So we can draw those in already.

0:01:05.820,0:01:11.250
Maybe I have to make it a
little bit bigger, as a circle.

0:01:11.250,0:01:12.510
So, this one looks good.

0:01:12.510,0:01:29.010
So I have here a place s1,
a place s2 and a place s3.

0:01:40.970,0:01:47.690
Okay, so I've already used up
this information, so to speak.

0:01:47.690,0:01:53.180
Then there should be four
transitions t1, t2, t3, t4.

0:01:53.180,0:01:55.280
I would have to
arrange them somewhere first.

0:01:55.280,0:02:15.530
So let's say for example, I
have here t1, t2, t3 and t4.

0:02:15.530,0:02:19.490
Then I would have used up
that information as well.

0:02:19.490,0:02:22.760
But the relevant information is, of
course, primarily what is said here.

0:02:22.760,0:02:32.930
Or first, I might want to use the
information about the start marking.

0:02:32.930,0:02:40.430
It says the start marking for s1 is
2 and for s2 as well as for s3 is 0.

0:02:40.430,0:02:44.600
This means that I must have two tokens on

0:02:44.600,0:02:47.990
the first position and
nothing on the other two.

0:02:47.990,0:02:57.800
I help myself in such a way that
I now have the two tokens on s1.

0:02:57.800,0:02:59.360
Then I have used
the information down here about

0:03:00.710,0:03:04.520
the start marking
for the individual places.

0:03:04.520,0:03:10.220
And then I can deal with the arrows.

0:03:10.220,0:03:11.180
What it says here.

0:03:11.180,0:03:12.800
You can see here:

0:03:12.800,0:03:14.285
There are three places, four transitions.

0:03:14.285,0:03:18.050
There could well be more
entries than are written here.

0:03:18.050,0:03:22.160
Because we have to specify pre- and
post-weights for each transition for each place.

0:03:22.160,0:03:28.610
Here, 10 values are explicitly given.

0:03:28.610,0:03:32.870
And for all others, it says
here below, the value is 0.

0:03:32.870,0:03:33.950
All other weights are 0.

0:03:33.950,0:03:37.940
That is, we won't find them in
the graphical representation.

0:03:37.940,0:03:44.480
We just have to draw in all the
entries from here as arrows.

0:03:45.320,0:03:47.780
And there we just
start with the first one.

0:03:47.780,0:03:54.650
So what does this entry want to tell us?

0:03:54.650,0:03:56.090
It says:

0:03:56.090,0:04:01.070
For t1, the pre-weight
of s1 is exactly 1.

0:04:01.070,0:04:06.584
That means there must
be such an arrow here.

0:04:06.584,0:04:10.520
Okay, that's what that
first line there says.

0:04:10.520,0:04:12.170
What does the second line say?

0:04:12.170,0:04:13.310
The second line says:

0:04:13.310,0:04:23.150
For t2, there must be an input
arrow from s2 with the value 1.

0:04:23.150,0:04:30.410
And "with the value 1" simply means that there
is an arrow here, but there is no weight on it.

0:04:30.410,0:04:35.690
So from s2 to t2 there must be an arrow.

0:04:35.690,0:04:36.740
Let that be this one.

0:04:36.740,0:04:44.480
Okay, to t2 there must
also be an arrow from s3.

0:04:44.480,0:04:48.620
Let that be this one.

0:04:48.620,0:05:05.330
To t3, there must be an
arrow from s3, with weight 2.

0:05:05.330,0:05:19.580
So from s3 to t3, because that's the
pre-weight for t3 with respect to s3.

0:05:19.580,0:05:26.780
So from s3 to t3 an arrow, with weight 2.

0:05:26.780,0:05:31.336
That's why we add a two to the arrow.

0:05:31.336,0:05:34.430
And so it goes on.

0:05:34.430,0:05:43.040
So from s2 to t4 a simple arrow.

0:05:45.980,0:05:48.920
Now come the follow-up weights.

0:05:48.920,0:05:58.096
So from t1 to s3 a simple arrow.

0:05:58.096,0:06:03.290
We can draw it around here, for example.

0:06:03.290,0:06:09.590
From t2 to s1 with weight 2.

0:06:09.590,0:06:25.280
From t3 to s1 a simple arrow.

0:06:29.390,0:06:36.500
From t3 to s2 a simple arrow.

0:06:37.820,0:06:44.540
And finally from t4 to s3.

0:06:47.960,0:06:58.190
And so, unless I somehow got it wrong
or forgot something, what we see

0:06:58.190,0:07:03.560
here now would be the Petri net
in graphical representation, which

0:07:03.560,0:07:07.100
corresponds to the given
mathematical representation.

0:07:07.100,0:07:08.780
You could maybe make that prettier.

0:07:08.780,0:07:10.400
You might have been able to
layout that even differently.

0:07:10.400,0:07:13.760
The nodes could have been arranged
differently in this graphical representation.

0:07:13.760,0:07:15.320
But that wouldn't make any difference.

0:07:15.320,0:07:21.110
Yes, if I were to somehow move
individual nodes somewhere else here

0:07:21.110,0:07:25.640
and drag the connection along, it
would still be the same Petri net.

0:07:25.640,0:07:31.130
That would just be a different graphical
representation for the same Petri net, and it

0:07:31.130,0:07:36.680
would be according to the mathematical
representation written down here before.

0:07:36.680,0:07:40.010
Okay, and you should be
able to do that both ways.
