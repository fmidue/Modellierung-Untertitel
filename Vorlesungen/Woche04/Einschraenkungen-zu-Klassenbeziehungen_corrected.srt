109 # slide
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,410
I had talked several
times now about valid or

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,530
invalid constellations in class diagrams.

00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,180
In particular, remembering last
week, we had said that

00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:20,490
in the context of inheritance, it is
not allowed that there is, say, cyclic inheritance.

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,560
Or a class inheriting from itself.

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,780
Or a class being duplicate subclasses
of another class, so to speak.

00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,880
However, I had also emphasized in
this week's videos that there are

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,910
no such restrictions for association
and then also for aggregation.

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,200
We had also seen examples.

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,340
An example of such a
constellation, and also a cyclic one.

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,020
Yes, a cycle of association
and aggregation relationship would be okay.

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,940
It looks different for composition.

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,570
So:

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,850
For association/aggregation,
no restriction

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,410
on cycles/self-reference or presence of
multiple relationships between same classes.

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,640
For composition, however, cycles of
any kind are again forbidden.

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,090
So for composition there
must be no such cycle.

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,510
With composition there
must be no self-reference.

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,230
And there must not be any two
classes which are directly cyclic in this form.

00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,515
Here, in fact, the direction
of the containing relation is important.

00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:30,690
So this is forbidden here because one
could contain oneself here in the circle.

00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,150
And also here the problem
is that there is this cycle,

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,300
because the two
compositions are directed opposite.

00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,510
If one would turn this relationship around here and
"E" would contain "F" in two ways, so to

00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,100
speak, then this could still be valid
depending on the multiplicities that are on it.

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,190
We'll discuss that on a
slide in a moment as well.

00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,570
The important thing here is:

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:04,770
These are really prohibitions
that are specific to composition.

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,230
So, if you were to replace one of the

00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,110
compositions here with an aggregation,
it would be legal again.

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,790
So the aggregation and
also association don't count with

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,277
respect to this
restriction for composition.

00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:22,100
There it's really about the fact that you're
not allowed to draw circles with composition, for example.

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,980
Now what about non-cyclic relationships?

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,280
For example, double composition

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,530
relationship between two partners, but
not in this cyclic way?

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,060
Even then, there are still
limitations, and they come from the

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,990
fact that yes, a part may not belong
to more than one whole at the same time.

00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:50,150
And that this is something
that goes beyond multiplicities alone.

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,690
So, for example, in these relations there

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,630
are situations which simply do
not make sense with the multiplicities.

00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,540
You would be allowed to syntactically write
"1" to each of these two ends here.

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,410
But one could then never
generate an object diagram for it.

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,560
One could not specify any objects "a", "b",
"c" of the classes "A", "B", "C", which would

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,480
fulfill this in any meaningful way.

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,400
Because each object of the class C would have to
belong, if here a 1 and here a 1 would stand,

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,430
always at the same time to an object of the
class A and to an object of the class B.

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,330
But that is forbidden, because a part
may not belong to more than one whole

00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,850
at the same time
when it comes to composition.

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,230
And in a similar way

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,920
restrictions arise even
beyond the syntactic requirement.

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:50,180
One cannot have multiplicity
1 at both compositions.

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,070
Because then one could
not form meaningful instances.

00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,150
One would have to look at
that more exactly, what is permitted here.

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,590
Which constellation is
allowed here or not.

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,900
I will probably do
that in an extra video.

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,510
It should also be noted that

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:22,540
association/aggregation/composition also
interacts with inheritance.

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,080
This is because a subclass always inherits
associations, aggregations and compositions from the superclass

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,650
in addition to attributes and methods.

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:41,830
For example, if we have a class
diagram in the following form, yes we

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,950
have a composition between A and C, an aggregation
between B and C, and B inherits from A.

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,180
Then B inherits from
A also this composition.

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,510
That is, there is obviously an
aggregation between B and C here, but

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,540
there is also a
composition due to the inheritance.

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,530
And that in turn
holds potential for conflict.

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,970
If this were a composition,
then it would not look

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,430
like there are
any duplicate compositions.

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,515
But since B inherits from A, there would
then suddenly be two compositions between B and C.

00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:20,800
This is not the case now,
because we have composition and aggregation.

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,180
But in general, inheritance also ensures

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,170
that association/aggregation/composition
is inherited.

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:41,620
And then that can have consequences, for instance,
for this question of the presence of composition cycles.

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,260
So that's what has
to be paid attention to.

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:53,290
Here, things don't get
in each other's way now.
