85 # slide
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,380
We had dealt with classes last
week and then towards the end

00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,250
especially with
inheritance between classes.

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,310
The last slide on this was
this slide with such artificial classes,

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,920
where it was
about structural restrictions.

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,110
So that certain kinds of

00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,020
inheritance relationships should
not be allowed.

00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,560
And that was independent of the content of
the classes, that's why those were such artificial names.

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,010
Now we want to
deal with content structuring instead.

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,340
Therefore now also
more concrete examples.

00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:50,220
Here is a constellation, where we have a
class "car" and several classes inherit from it.

00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:57,330
This picture here with the converging
arrows or strokes, which then all end

00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:04,080
in an inheritance arrow towards
car (Auto), is equivalent to simply

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,660
having such an inheritance
arrow here four times each.

00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,400
There's nothing cyclic here.

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,160
So structurally, that's fine.

00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,480
And even though we haven't
specified attributes and methods now

00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,750
(I left the boxes blank in each

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,750
case), we can reason from the
names that these may be meaningful relationships.

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,650
So we don't look at what happens
to the attributes or methods in inheritance,

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,910
but just consider this basic
requirement that inheritance should always be

00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,700
a true
generalization/specialization relationship.

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,490
So we should let other
class inherit from "car" if

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,370
representatives of these other
classes are also cars.

00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,940
A private car is also a
car, just a more specialized car.

00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,180
A diesel car is also a
car, just a more special car, etc.

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,520
That's why, in terms of
content, these are meaningful inheritance relationships.

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,820
Each of these four
subclasses is a meaningful

00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,270
specialization of the general concept.

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,780
We can let that stand for now.

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,050
Interestingly, if you look
at the content here, different

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,410
aspects have led to the specialization.

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:34,620
Certainly, all these four special types
of cars are special manifestations of

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,010
cars, but for different
reasons and in different respects.

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:46,320
If you take a look at these four
types of special cars, you will see that, for

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,250
example, the two on the left, private
car and diesel car, are both special cars.

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,860
But somehow in different ways they
are more special than general cars.

00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,390
The private car is
more special in terms of

00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,940
ownership than an unknown general car:

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,540
Who owns this car?

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,300
While diesel car is also a
special car, but specialized in another direction.

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,340
That is, not in terms of
ownership, but in terms of propulsion.

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,090
That is, private car and diesel
car are different kinds of cars,

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,970
but not in the sense that they
could be seen in contrast with each other.

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,010
So private cars are not
the opposite of diesel cars,

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,960
nor do they contrast with each other
in any other respect, so to speak.

00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,330
They are just
completely different dimensions

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,000
in which a car can be specialized.

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,500
The example is chosen so that this would not
now be the case for all pairings of subclasses.

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,520
For example, "private car" and
"company car" are actually not only

00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,460
more specialized cars, but also
specialized along the same dimension.

00:03:53,460 --> 00:04:00,750
Private car and company car are actually in this
sense a pair of opposites, a pair of contrasts.

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,000
Different from private
car and diesel car.

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,060
And the same is true
for diesel car and solar car.

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,290
They too are different kinds of
special cars, but somehow they have

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,250
become specialized in the same respect,
namely in terms of their propulsion.

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,520
Which again would not apply
to company car and solar car.

00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,460
Those are specialized
cars for different reasons.

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,180
So somehow private car/company car seem
to go together in a sense as

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,520
a direction in which a
car can become more specialized.

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,790
And diesel car/solar car
also seem to kind

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:43,400
of belong together in that sense
as a way to specialize "car."

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,440
And this observation can also
be represented in the diagram.

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,880
So represent it in such a way that it
becomes clear that private car and company car are more

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,890
specialized cars in one respect, and diesel car/solar
car are more specialized cars in another respect.

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:04,850
Instead of just having all four inherit from
car side by side here, you could group

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,070
these subclasses into
groups, so-called generalization groups.

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,210
So these individual generalization

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,210
relationships, which were four on the
previous slide, you would group them together.

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,130
This could then look
like this, for example:

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,000
We still have the
car as the central class.

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,880
Also as the top class, which is inherited from,
but which itself does not inherit from anything else.

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,010
And we still have
the four subclasses, which

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:37,790
each inherit once from "car" via these
arrows here and once via these arrows here.

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:44,450
But we've summarized that these
two form a group, that

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:53,270
is, a special kind of
inheritance or special expression of cars.

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,390
And have even noted here in
what respect (I had said earlier

00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,450
"ownership", I could have just
said "the status of the car"):

00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,740
Is it a private car or a company car?

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,940
That would be one way of specializing.

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,630
And diesel car/solar car
are also both subclasses of

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,490
"car", but they are grouped here in such
a way that you can see that they

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,580
are specialized according to a specific
criterion, namely the criterion of propulsion.

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,740
Each group, once the group
and once the group, sort

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,860
of subdivides the set of cars
as a whole in different ways.

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,560
Of course, this could be important in
an application that is to be modeled.

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,320
Because for instance in different parts
of the application simply different generalization

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,330
groups are relevant and then
also object instances of other generalization

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,280
groups do not appear at all.

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:55,230
So if we somehow model cars for the
vehicles of a company, then perhaps the distinction

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,830
between private and company cars is
relevant for the accounting of this company.

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,630
Because it has to deal with it in a
different way from a tax point of view, depending

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,840
on the status of a car that is used.

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,330
While for other aspects, such
as the company's ecological balance

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,090
sheet, it is perhaps more important to
differentiate between cars according to their drive system.

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:28,215
And therefore, in a certain part of the
application, the status may not be relevant at all.

00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:32,490
And then perhaps only instances
of this type would occur there.

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,910
In order to be able to distinguish this,
and to be able to give the child

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:53,610
a name, so to speak, a name
is somehow annotated here in each case at

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,260
this summarized inheritance branching.

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,590
Directly in the diagram, a meaningful
name of the respective generalization group.

00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,700
You can even do this if
there is only one specialization type.

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,280
So on a slide before, if you
actually have four subclasses of a common superclass

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,760
and they're really all specialized according
to the same dimension, you could still

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:27,920
write a meaningful name on
this "ridge" of inheritance arrows here.

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,250
But in the concrete example, there
are actually two different kinds of generalization.

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:43,310
That's why there are these
two different groups with different names.

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,550
Now one can assign properties

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,430
to these generalization groups, i.e. this
left side and the right side.

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:59,030
So this decomposition of all cars
into private cars and company cars

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,620
or into diesel cars and solar cars,
it doesn't have to be a real decomposition.

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,000
Perhaps it is not exhaustive at all.

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,140
Perhaps there are also overlaps.

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,270
So if you think about which
properties might be relevant, you end up

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:20,030
with a pair of opposites regarding
the exhaustion of all instances and a

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:27,350
pair of opposites regarding the question of
whether each instance can be uniquely assigned.

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,680
This is then
called "complete" versus "incomplete".

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,580
So here the first property would
be that a generalization group is complete

00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,630
if it actually conceptually covers
all conceivable instances of the superclass.

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:47,000
So if every car is actually
either a company car or a private

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,470
car, and there is
not a third possibility.

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,450
Then this generalization group
would be "complete", otherwise "incomplete".

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:59,480
That is, if there
were also possible instances

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,860
of the superclass that are
not exhausted by the subclasses.

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,870
So that would be the case for our 'propulsion' example.

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,400
If there is a third class of
possible cars besides solar car and diesel car,

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,060
then the distinction between diesel and
solar cars would not be complete.

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:23,720
That is the one question, the
one pair of properties, of which "complete"

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,340
or "incomplete" applies to a
concrete generalization group in each case.

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,480
Then there is this other
pair of properties: "overlapping" or "disjoint".

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,090
That is, overlapping or
disjoint from each other.

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,940
"Overlapping" means:

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,520
Instances are conceivable that could belong to
more than one of the specialization classes.

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:50,170
This could be imagined in the case of the
distinction between company and private cars, if there are

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:56,365
also cars that are a bit
of both, i.e., mixed-financed, so to speak.

00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,380
Then that distinction
would be "overlapping."

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,200
And "disjoint" would
be the opposite, namely

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,820
that these specializing classes
do not conceptually overlap.

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,660
If it is not possible to have such mixed

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,990
financing, if a car is
always in fact exactly either fully

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,950
corporate-owned or fully privately-owned,
then this subdivision, this generalization

00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,960
group, would
be called "disjoint".

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,590
And of course, if we have a choice
here between "complete" and "incomplete" and a choice

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:37,090
here between "overlapping" and "disjoint," then there
are a total of four possible combinations:

00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,590
complete-overlapping, incomplete-overlapping,
complete-disjoint, incomplete-disjoint.

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,690
We have four cases, and in fact you
can also think of constellations that actually occur

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,960
for each of the four cases.

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:58,150
We can go through this for
our example from before and other examples.

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:05,050
So, for example, the left side of our
example distinction seen earlier, the generalization relationship between

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,980
"car" on the one
hand and "private car"/"company car"

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,660
on the other.

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,370
So distinction by status.

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:23,455
That's a generalization group and we could
consider that to be complete and disjoint.

00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:28,720
So let's assume there's no other kind of
status that a car can have in that

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,840
respect, and we don't
allow for mixed private/corporate cars.

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:44,260
Then that would be a complete
and disjoint distinction in that respect.

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:51,860
Then, in fact, what you end up doing
is really partitioning the instances of the superclass.

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,890
So each car falls into
exactly one of these subclasses.

00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:05,000
Neither does it fall out of the classes, nor does
it fall into more than one class at a time.

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,920
If we take the right-hand
side of our diagram from

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,670
just now, that is, the
distinction by drive, that's also disjoint.

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,780
It's also a disjoint distinction because there
is no car that is both diesel

00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,100
and solar at the same
time (I'm just assuming now, technically).

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,900
But it's not
"complete", it's incomplete, because

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,080
there are still
gasoline cars, for example.

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:40,080
That is another
combination of properties.

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,340
Then "complete" and
"overlapping" are still missing.

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:53,130
This could be imagined, for
example, not with cars and their

00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,520
subclasses, but with
animals and their subclasses.

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,610
For example, if we distinguish animals by
habitat, then there are land animals, water

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,070
animals, and air
animals or flying animals.

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,730
I would say
that's a complete distinction.

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,040
So, there are no further habitats for
animals if we limit

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,880
ourselves to planet Earth and
don't somehow add outer space.

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,980
But one could argue that this distinction

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,790
is "overlapping," that
is, not "disjoint."

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,660
Why?

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:31,290
Because, for example, there are animals
that are both land and water animals.

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,820
Turtles, for example.

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,980
They are neither clearly assigned to the land
habitat, nor clearly assigned to the water habitat.

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:45,330
In this respect, this would not
be an overlap-free or disjoint distinction.

00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,470
What we also see here
in the example is that

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,460
of course this distinction does not always
have to happen exactly in two subclasses.

00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,370
This example here might still
have suggested,

00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,160
that we always subdivide
exactly into two subclasses.

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,540
Of course, that's not true.

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,440
We can see that in this example.

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,380
There can also be
more than two subclasses.

00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:10,980
And still, one can then investigate
these properties in a meaningful way.

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:19,170
Then there is one more
constellation missing, namely "incomplete" and "overlapping".

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,000
And we can get these, for example,

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,400
if we simply omit
a subclass from this diagram.

00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,470
So forget that there
are also flying animals.

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,690
Then we would be at this picture.

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,140
This is still
"overlapping", because there are

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,580
still the turtles, which would
fit into both subclasses here.

00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:46,230
But since the flying animals are missing,
this would not be a complete distinction.

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:54,220
Thus all four constellations would
be demonstrated by an example.
