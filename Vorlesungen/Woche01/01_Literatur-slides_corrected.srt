00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,770
All right, let me say a few
words about the literature.

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,520
First of all, the literature
is only meant as a supplement.

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,500
In principle, you should be able to
master the material of the lecture

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,560
and the exercises without additional books.
However, sometimes an extra book still helps.

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,170
Sometimes the literature presents the material
from a slightly different perspective than

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,530
the lecture, and that can sometimes
provide a nice additional approach.

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,830
O.k., here we first have a book that
is a very comprehensive book about UML.

00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:46,320
Yes, UML is a modeling method,
a modeling language, which

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,330
will be maybe about 50 percent of the
lecture, if I estimate that correctly.

00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,090
Maybe a little bit more, actually.
So we're going to need some

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,390
UML concepts and that's why a book
on UML is not wrong, of course.

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,550
This is a book from which I have
taken some examples into the lecture.

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,560
So if you get this book, for example,
from the library or otherwise, and

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,840
browse through it, you might
recognize some of the examples

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,220
that I have in the
lecture. In that respect, it's

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,250
actually quite suitable, the book.
Unfortunately, in the description,

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,230
even when it comes to formal things,
this book is sometimes not quite clean.

00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,600
There are certain inconsistencies, and thereby,
partly also deviations from the lecture,

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,080
where I tried to
present things very uniformly.

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,190
But just as an introduction, and
especially for examples, this

00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:40,410
book is definitely very good. Okay,
then there is another English-language

3 # slide
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,420
book, which is very specific
to object-oriented design,

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:53,850
which will also be a part of the lecture.
That's this book here, you can find

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,040
that through the library as well. That
also contains a nice motivation and

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,270
examples, some of which also
show up in the lecture.

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,930
But it's not really
a modeling book otherwise.

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,750
You can see that in the title: it
says something about implementation.

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,270
This is a book that certainly
contains some modeling parts,

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,760
in view of object-oriented design, but
it is perhaps a bit more relevant later,

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,700
especially when you attend,
for example, the lecture

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,510
Advanced Programming Techniques. So
there, to my knowledge, the book is

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,600
not used as a textbook, but certain
things, the topics that you're going

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,380
to cover there, also appear in this
book. So if you plan to listen to

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,430
that later as well, maybe that would be a
good book, which bridges from modeling to

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,870
the Advanced Programming Techniques
course, which you would probably

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:50,440
attend with Professor Pauli.
O.K., another book, very general,

4 # slide
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,330
you also see UML in the title. Software
Engineering, it's about the application of

00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:02,800
UML in the area of modeling software.
Things are covered rather rather informally, not in full detail,

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,610
so less formal than I'm sure
I'll do in lecture, but also not

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:13,840
unsuitable as an introduction and overview.
What's also particularly nice about this book is

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,010
that you wouldn't have to buy
this or get it from the library.

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,660
You can also read this electronically, and in
fact, if you're logged into the Uni-Account, so

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,640
you're logged into the uniaccount, you can also
read this book electronically through this link

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,450
here. That should still work. If
necessary, if you are not in the

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,350
University network, you have to access it via VPN.
Maybe this VPN access has already been explained

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,180
to you, or you have already used this
in the last semesters, if you are not

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:53,495
in the first year.
Okay, another book on UML.

5 # slide
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:57,290
Although UML doesn't completely make up
the lecture (we'll see other books in

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,460
a moment), here's another book
on UML. It's very comprehensive,

00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,070
with only excerpts relevant sections for
us. Interesting perhaps for

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,550
you because it is also available in English.
Here you can see the German book, but

00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:17,180
for the English-speaking students, this book is
also available in English and as far as I know,

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,560
it is also available in our library.
So at least the original can

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,100
be borrowed there. Well,
then I had already

6 # slide
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,400
said, the course will not only be about
UML. Another important modeling tool

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,830
that we will use in the lecture
is the so-called Petri nets.

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,770
While you may already know UML, at least
class diagrams, from school classes,

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,830
Petri nets are probably most familiar
to you if you have taken the

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,940
computer science prerequisite course or
if you have attended other lectures as

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,950
ISE students where Petri nets were also used.
There are several books on that as well, again

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:04,370
there's a book available online. If
you're logged into the Uni account,

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,080
here's a paper on Petri nets,
which is very example driven.

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:18,710
So it's less formal, but contains many
examples that will be useful to us.

7 # slide
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:26,210
Then, a little bit in contrast, I've
cited a book here that is very formal.

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,330
So, this deals with more
formal aspects of Petri nets.

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,900
Again, that fits in with the lecture
as far as what we're going to do.

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,780
We're not going to cover everything that's in this book,
but some more formal concepts that we're going to explore

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:45,350
regarding Petri nets, you might find in
this book rather than the book shown before.

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,560
And also this book should be
available to you electronically

8 # slide
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:58,440
if you access it through the Uni account. Okay,
let's discuss something in English once more.

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,560
The two books just now were German
books. For the English-speaking

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,520
students, but also for others,
this article might be interesting.

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,339
It is in English and has a slightly
different style than the books.

00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:13,920
The books are textbooks, but this
is a review article that was

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,360
written quite a while ago. It also
contains good motivation, examples,

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,210
and also discusses some of the formal
properties we will be looking at.

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,670
You see this up here, Properties, Analysis and
Applications, so both examples, applications,

00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:39,000
and the properties and analysis of Petri
nets, which is what we'll be doing.

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,350
Of course, since it's only a part of the lecture,
not in the same depth as it's approached here in

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:52,560
the article, but nevertheless, that's also a
possible approach to this part of the lecture.

9 # slide
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,680
OK, in a similar vein, also as
a scholarly article rather than

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:07,260
a textbook, here is an article by Harel.
That should also be available to you, and

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,200
even without the restriction of having to
be logged in from the Uni-account.

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,780
Why is this article relevant?
Because it lays the foundation for a

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:25,080
part of UML, namely UML state diagrams. This
will be the last chapter in the lecture

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,172
where we deal with this
particular type of statecharts or

00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:33,750
state diagrams in UML. This is
often perceived as the most complex

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,840
part of the lecture.
UML statecharts are also

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,010
explained to some extent in UML books.
But in a very nice and intuitive way,

00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,830
in my opinion, they are just described in the
original article that formed the basis for

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,570
UML state diagrams later. The
syntax is not one hundred percent

00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,220
exactly the same there, but the important concepts
we will be looking at from statecharts, you

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:12,400
will find well explained in English in that
article. Okay, I think I have one more book ready.

10 # slide
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,820
Exactly, this is the book, also
available in English in the library.

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,510
To my knowledge not electronically,
but as a hard copy.

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:30,640
Again, a very comprehensive
book that covers a lot on UML.

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,350
In particular, that's why I still
included it here, it also covers the

00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:40,960
dynamic aspects, dynamic modeling with UML, which
doesn't necessarily happen to the same extent in all of

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,720
the UML references that I
mentioned before. Yes, we will look

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,070
at static and dynamic modeling.
Static modeling with UML is explained

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:56,170
very well in very many places.
Also, simply in introductory books

00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,530
on software engineering, the dynamic
aspects, which include statecharts,

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,560
which are certainly more difficult and are
not covered everywhere in the same way,

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,100
are articulated in this book just
so. Okay, again to repeat: You

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,220
don't have to read any of these books.
You don't have to pick up any of

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,340
these books at all if you don't like to
do so. But it might be helpful if you need

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,000
more examples, want to read something
again in a different way than

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,010
I explain it in the lecture, or just want
to have more practice material as well.
