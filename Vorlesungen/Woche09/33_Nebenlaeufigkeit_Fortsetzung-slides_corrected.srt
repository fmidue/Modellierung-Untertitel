178 # slide
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,730
Back to the slides, but the same examples

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,220
that we just saw in the other video.

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,860
And that is, first of all, here's
the example that I had noticed that for

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,680
this marking that we see here,
t2 and t3 are activated concurrently.

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,480
The intuition was that that was
because I could sort of grab these

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,770
two tokens and move them
through t2 and t3 simultaneously.

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,220
That was the intuition
for that kind of parallelism.

00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,550
But strictly speaking, the term
is defined mathematically, by this definition:

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,710
So I actually have to do
the math that in each case this

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,230
relation holds, for this example
and for the other examples.

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,360
Let's do that.

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,010
What would be the relevant
pre-weight functions in this case?

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,810
The preweight functions of t2 and t3.

00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:00,720
And I'll write each of
those down in tuple notation.

00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,990
We fix ourselves on the
place order s1, s2, s3, s4.

00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,140
Then, for example, the
pre-weight function of t2

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,400
is exactly the function which can
be written down as the 4-tuple (0,1,0,0).

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,950
Because the only input arrow
here is from s2.

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,100
And analogously at t3
the preweight function is (0,0,1,0).

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,920
Because of this

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,560
input arrow going from s3 to t3, and
because there are no other incoming arrows to t3.

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,370
That explains these two statements here.

00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,090
Now, to prove that
t2 and t3 are concurrent,

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,620
you have to sum
these two pre-weight functions.

00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,810
And this is done with this
sum symbol, which performs element-wise additions.

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,820
That is, what is on the left here would

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,130
be the vector addition of
these two 4-tuples, that is, (0,1,1,0).

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,330
And in that case, it turns out
that this is exactly equal (less than or equal to would do,

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,750
but it is even exactly equal in
that case) to the marking (0,1,1,0), which

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,200
also turns out if we take
the current marking of this Petri net.

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,630
Because on s1 there is
nothing, on s2 there is

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,170
something, on s3 there is something (and exactly
one token each), on s4 there is nothing.

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,190
That means, here this
criterion is exactly fulfilled.

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,720
Therefore we can also say:
t2 and t3 are activated concurrently.

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,100
In the previous video, I
had also discussed what would

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,540
happen, for example, if one were to
create another arrow from s3 to t2.

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,830
And then we had seen first:

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,730
Then t2 and t3 would
no longer be activated concurrently,

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,860
because the requirements for t2 and those for t3
would get in each other's way, so to speak.

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,400
Because you can send this one token either to t2
or to t3, but not both at the same time.

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,520
What would this mean
for the mathematical version?

00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,890
Nothing would change for t3.

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:11,400
But by the additional arrow from
s3 to t2 something changes for t2.

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,020
Namely, this additional arrow turns
this 0 into a 1.

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:26,820
Because the arrow must be
represented/reflected in the pre-weight function.

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,040
And that would be this 1 here,
because t2 then requests a token from s3.

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,460
So there would be a 1
here, where my cursor is currently pointing.

00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,970
The sum would result
in (0,1,2,0) instead of (0,1,1,0).

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,630
And (0,1,2,0) would not be
less than or equal to (0,1,1,0).

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,310
Even if there would be more tokens on
s4, so that the sum of the tokens

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,450
in this marking would be much
larger, there would still be simply

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,630
the problem concerning this only one
token lying on s3 due to (0,1,2,0).

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,360
What I had also already
discussed in the video was:

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,750
However, if one then put
down a second token on s3,

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,364
then t2 and t3 would again be
activated concurrently, because then that was enough.

00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:15,870
Then you would send a token
up here and send one to

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,030
t3, and that's not mutually exclusive.

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,230
That would correspond to the situation
where we have (0,1,1,0), here (0,0,1,0), the

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,590
sum would be (0,1,2,0),
and that would be okay.

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,420
If there was at least a 2 here,
which would correspond to the second token on s3.

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,440
So there, what I
intuitively tried to observe simply

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,400
graphically on the Petri net itself,
regarding t2 and t3, coincides with what

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,394
the mathematical definition (which we had here
on the slide) gives for this example.

00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:52,180
And that will coincide with each
of the other examples as well.

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,850
The next example was this example here.

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,110
There we had found

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,590
that t1, t2, t3 are all
three activated concurrently, for this marking.

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,370
Not only can there be two, but (this
also showed up on the slide) there can be

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,590
more than two transitions in this
set T', so they can be concurrently activated.

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,750
If that condition is satisfied here.

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,700
Is it here?

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,980
So this assertion from the
previous video that t1, t2,

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,940
t3 are concurrently activated, can that also
be verified by doing the math?

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,770
Well that's very
easy, very straightforward.

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:45,370
All three preweight functions for t1, t2,
t3 are each exactly the function that

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,520
says to take a token
from s1, and that s2, s3,

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,960
s4 are irrelevant to the
possibility of firing the three transitions.

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,480
Then we have
these three pre-weight functions.

00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,580
Their sum is exactly (3,0,0,0).

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,055
And it is again the
case that this exactly coincides.

00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:03,220
The sum comes out to (3,0,0,0),
and that is exactly equal, and

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,780
therefore also less than or equal to,
the marking shown.

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,230
This is because we have
as many tokens to consume.

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,850
Not too many, not too few.

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,600
Many would not be bad.

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,090
If there were 4 here,
the "less than or equal to" would be fulfilled.

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,820
But "too few" would
just prevent firing, or

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,680
prevent the concurrent
activation of all three.

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
It is also clear, of course,
that t1, t2 are also activated concurrently.

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,700
We could ignore t3 and
say: t1, t2 are activated concurrently.

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,950
Because if we just add the pre-weight
functions of t1 and t2, (2,0,0,0) comes out.

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,930
This is also
less than or equal to (3,0,0,0).

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,570
This again agrees with this observation from
here that if a set of transitions

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,020
is concurrently activated, then it also
holds for any subset of them.

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,550
Then I had the example where
I actually removed one of the tokens.

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,030
So where we have only two tokens
left in s1 at the beginning, but

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,790
the rest of the Petri net is unchanged.

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,210
There we had already said:

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,900
Then it can no longer be the
case that all three are activated concurrently.

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,780
In fact, for this example we then get
that pairwise each two of the transitions are

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,230
activated concurrently, but not
all three at the same time.

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,170
So every two-element set, which we
can form over transitions, is a set,

00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:29,440
where the transitions contained in it
for this constellation are activated concurrently.

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,500
However, this is not true for
the total set t1, t2, t3.

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,610
We see:

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,250
We cannot use these two tokens to
satisfy t1, t2, t3 all at once.

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,360
What does this mean mathematically?

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,000
Here again, t1, t2, t3
all have the same pre-weight function.

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,870
Namely, this one that we also
just had on the previous slide.

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,060
And it's also true that in
each case the pairwise sums of

00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,790
two pre-weight functions give
a marking, namely (2,0,0,0), which

00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,920
is not undercut anywhere by
the marking shown here.

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,090
So this is true for any
combination of two of the transitions.

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,200
However, if we take all three transitions, we
would also have to make this triple sum.

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,090
That would be (3,0,0,0), and that is
not less than or equal to (2,0,0,0).

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:26,050
That's why that's not enough, or t1,
t2, t3 are not all three activated concurrently.

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,520
Then we had this example.

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,660
I'm not going to do the math
there again, although of course you could.

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,630
In that example, we had discussed that

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:47,740
one of each of the two transitions is
concurrent with t3, but not t1 and t2.

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,050
Unless, of course,
one added another token.

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,800
So we had stated:

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,700
The sets \{t1, t3\} and also \{t2, t3\} are
in each case activated concurrently, because the firing of

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:04,480
t3 is just as it were, contact-free
to the firing of t1 and/or t2.

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,570
But not \{t1, t2\} together and consequently
not \{t1, t2, t3\} all three together.

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,400
Because then again would be valid:

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,370
If t1, t2, t3 were activated concurrently,
then t1, t2 would also have to be activated concurrently.

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,600
But this is not the case, because we
cannot satisfy t1 and t2 at the same time

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,190
with these three tokens (because of
this only one token in the middle).

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,390
This is what I had discussed.

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,240
With one more token it would be possible.

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,500
Then t1, t2 and t3
would actually be activated concurrently.

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,450
We had also discussed this.

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,120
What this example also shows is
that unlike causality (as discussed at the

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,880
end of last week), the
notion of concurrency is not transitive.

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,680
So it's like this here:
t1 and t3 are concurrent, t3

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,970
and t2 are concurrent, but
t1 and t2 are not concurrent.

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,590
It was different with causality.

00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,700
If t1 was a necessary condition for t2
and t2 was a necessary condition for t3,

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,280
then t1 was also
a necessary condition for t3.

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:25,700
This is not necessarily analogous for
three transitions with respect to concurrency.

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,600
So much for the examples.

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,890
Then I'd like to briefly
discuss some properties, some observations about

00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:37,220
concurrency, before we get to the
notion of conflict in the next video.

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:47,810
One observation is (I had also gone through this
in the video on an example) that if we

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,490
have such sets and a
marking, so that the transitions of

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,000
this set are activated concurrently,
then any arrangement of the transitions

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,920
is a valid firing sequence starting from
m. This is the case with this set.

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,580
I had discussed this exactly on the
example for the case that we put

00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,370
another token on here, so that t1, t2,
t3 were activated concurrently, all at the same time.

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,686
Then you could also fire in any
order: t1, t2, t3; t1, t3, t2; etc.

00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:16,820
I had then written that
down, all possible firing sequences.

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,640
All six that would be
possible as permutations of t1,

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,180
t2, t3, and that's a general observation.

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,690
So if I have a
set of concurrently activated transitions,

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,290
then we won't be able to tell from a firing sequence
that they fire in parallel (because the firing

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,660
sequences are always listings of transitions),
but at least then any

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,920
arbitrary order of the corresponding
transitions is a valid firing sequence.

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,020
So any sequence in which each transition

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,570
from T' occurs exactly once
lets us fire from m.

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,270
Not that we get stuck somewhere.

00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,470
And out comes a marking
m', and that's always the same.

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:02,060
So for an m and any set
of concurrently activated transitions, it can't be that

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,100
if we change the order of the
transitions from the set when firing, we

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,770
somehow come out at a different result.

00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,850
This also speaks for
this at least conceptual consideration:

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,560
It's kind of parallel.

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,860
We're writing down firing sequences,

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,080
but the order between
these concurrently activated transitions doesn't matter.

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,720
In the end, the same thing comes
out unless we do something else in between.

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,170
It's really just a matter of:

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:32,540
If we have this set T'
of activated transitions and we execute them

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,410
from a marking m in any order
(again, you could have seen this in the

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,300
example that was in the video; because no
matter what token would be on here and

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,520
no matter what order I
then fire t1, t2, t3), the

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,396
result is that in the end there is
exactly one token on each of the subsequent places.

00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:55,890
That would be a case
where this becomes effective and visible.

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:06,750
This ensures that in the one example at the beginning
of the last video, which I think we had already

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,430
seen, in the reachability graph then
always a kind of arrangement of transitions

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,430
will result in such a
way for transitions activated concurrently.

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,070
There I had had
that before for two transitions.

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,370
I think they were t2 and t3
in the causality example from last week.

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:29,910
Namely, if we have
something like this, very

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,750
simple, two obviously concurrently activated
transitions, and we set

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,520
up the reachability graph just for
this example, then it looks like this:

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,840
There is this square here.

00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,700
I have also called it a "diamond" before.

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,144
It depends on how you draw it.

00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:51,000
In higher dimensions, it will look even more
obvious, so to speak, like a crystal structure.

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,740
The point is here:

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,340
Since t1, t2 are activated concurrently,
the order doesn't matter.

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,450
That means, from any marking (in
this case the start marking of

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,940
this very simple Petri net) we can
fire first t1, t2 or t2, t1.

00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,470
And it results in this
typical structure, which we find here,

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,290
if we have
concurrently activated transitions.

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,230
That's because the order doesn't matter.

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,940
And as I said:

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,870
If we have more than two
transitions, then that just becomes something

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,180
like such a higher-dimensional
mathematical construct.

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,270
So for instance if we have
that, but also in other Petri

00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,170
nets where we have three concurrent transitions
(and that doesn't have to be as obvious

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,160
or as boring as it is here,
but is true for any constellation where

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,180
we have three concurrently activated
transitions), then such structures arise.

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,150
Again because any order of
transitions will be possible, and

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,040
that then leads to such
structures in the reachability graph.

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,630
Maybe, or usually, of course
embedded in larger reachability graphs.

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,520
But you can then recognize that.

00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,150
And then that speaks to
the fact that there is concurrency.

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:18,160
That's not proof of it, but it's a
certain identifying feature that you can look for.

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:32,580
Then you can ask yourself if that's
sort of guaranteed that there's concurrency if

00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,560
you see a structure like that, or
if you know that all the transitions from

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:44,310
a certain set are fireable from
the same marking in any order.

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,130
So if we have a marking m
and a set T' such that any arrangement

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,870
of these transitions is a valid
firing sequence, is it also the

00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,070
case that with certainty the transitions
from T' are activated concurrently for m?

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,070
This is the converse of
the observations we just discussed.

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,820
And the answer is:

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,530
No, that's not necessarily true.

00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,660
And here's a simple counterexample.

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,660
You can use the example to think about:

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:19,050
If we take here \{t1, t2\}
as the set T', then of course

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,650
any order of firing is possible.

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,460
We can fire t1, can fire t2, we
can fire t1, t1, can fire t2, t2.

00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:33,690
The t1 and t2 are always activated,
but t1 and t2 are not activated concurrently.

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,220
This can be checked very easily.

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,890
Because for that we would have to be
able to fire t1, t2 at the same time.

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,570
So we would have to be able to fulfill
the preconditions of t1 and t2 at the same time.

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,430
But we can't do that with this one token.

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,190
And even if we recalculate this
with the preweight functions, we would

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,340
have the preweight function
1 in each case.

00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,410
There is only one place.

00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,390
So a tuple with a 1 each,

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:02,190
the sum would be 2, but the
current marking just has only one token.

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:09,000
So here t1, t2 are not activated
concurrently and yet it is the case that

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,190
they can be fired in any order.

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,120
That's ultimately due to
this loop structure here.

00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,250
Of course, this is
a somewhat mean Petri net

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,510
here because it has this
loop or two such loops.

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:38,690
By loop (or loops) we mean when there
is a transition and a place, so that

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:44,300
this transition would like to take
something out of this place (so

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,050
it has a positive pre-weight)
as well as put something in

00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,720
if it can fire (so
it also has a positive post-weight).

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,720
This leads exactly to such
structures in the Petri net.

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,260
Of course, the Petri net does
not have to look exactly like this.

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,100
This can occur somewhere
embedded in the Petri net.

00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,370
So other arrows are possible, to

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,920
other places or in
connection with other transitions.

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,370
But if we have a Petri net
in which such a thing does not occur

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,730
(in which there are no loops),
that is, we have a loop-free

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:21,530
Petri net, then the question from the
previous slide can actually be answered positively.

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,430
So if we then have a
marking and a set of transitions

00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:32,000
such that any arrangement of these
transitions leads to a valid firing

00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,980
sequence, then this set
will also be concurrently activated.

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,690
So then we can actually conclude from
the presence of, say, a "cube" that

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,880
there is a three-element
set of concurrently activated transitions.

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,270
We will not have to do that.

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,510
Whenever we have such questions
("Is there something concurrently activated?"), we

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,820
can calculate it concretely.

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:02,660
Of course, our criterion in each case
will be to determine it using this.

00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,040
Or if you have done that often
enough, you will of course recognize the things

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,690
from the Petri net itself,
and you don't necessarily have to

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,010
calculate that manually, as I
just did on the slides.

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,660
That's enough for the end of the
consideration of concurrency from the formal side.
