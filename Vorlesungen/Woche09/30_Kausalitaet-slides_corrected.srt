00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
We have now learned about
properties of Petri nets:

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,600
the liveness properties
including the question of

00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:18,240
freedom from deadlock, and resource constraint
properties, i.e., 1-safety and boundedness.

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,420
Other important notions we will look at

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,150
are causality, concurrency, and conflict.

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,240
So we'll be dealing with those.

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,570
This week, though, only with causality.

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,180
So concurrency and
conflict will be postponed

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,590
until next week, or
we'll deal with them then.

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,680
Then we will have formally defined almost all the
properties that were discussed informally before.

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,760
Questions about general fairness
would then still be open.

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,080
But we will not discuss these in
the lecture related to Petri nets.

00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,840
One difference of these three properties
from the ones we have seen so far

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,110
is that these are properties concerning
single transitions in a Petri net.

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,810
All the properties about
liveness and boundedness

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,260
were properties of Petri nets as a whole.

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,890
A Petri net is strongly live or not.

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,930
A Petri net is bounded or not.

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,810
The question of causality is not:

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,790
Is the Petri net causal?

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,050
But there one asks whether
certain transitions in a given

00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,600
Petri net have certain properties.

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,540
These are properties *in* Petri nets, not
properties *of* Petri nets as a whole.

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,460
Let us first consider again the definition
for the first property: causality.

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,770
This is defined with reference to
the notion of firing sequences,

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,600
which we have already considered
in a previous lecture.

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,660
And first defined formally here it says:

00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,600
Causality is about whether one transition
is a necessary condition for another.

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,860
Causality is, so to speak, the
dependence of one transition on another.

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,910
A transition t1 in a given Petri net is said to be a necessary

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,930
condition for the firing of transition t2 if it is the case

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,880
that t2 cannot be fired without t1 having been fired beforehand.

00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:32,200
So if for every firing sequence (using this notation t-tilde) that somehow leads from the

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:51,880
original initial marking to the firing
of t2, it is the case that this t-tilde

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,990
must in any case contain transition t1,
because otherwise it could not be true at all.

00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,730
Because we can't find any other

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,380
constellation where t2 is fired
and t1 wasn't fired before.

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,600
So if in such a constellation

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,710
in any case t1 must occur
in this firing sequence.

00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,410
Then t1 is called a
necessary condition for t2.

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,340
Because then we cannot fire t2
without having fired t1 before (maybe

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,350
not directly before,
but sometime before).

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,610
Of course, this is only interesting
if t2 is a transition that is

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,110
reachable at all, that is, it
occurs in the reachability graph.

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,035
This would already be the case for every
transition in weakly live Petri nets.

00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:37,210
Furthermore, the definition is not
interesting if t1 and t2 are equal.

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,000
Sometime, when t1 is

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,970
fireable or t2, sometime is the
first firing for each transition.

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,410
It can't have been fired before that.

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,250
So this is interesting for
weakly live Petri nets or at

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,160
least Petri nets where t2
can be fired at all.

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,860
As well as only for the case
that t1 and t2 are different.

00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,670
So this is the formal definition.

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,880
Again, you can look at the reachability

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,110
graph, especially if it's finite.

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,740
So, if we look at the reachability
graph and ask ourselves:

00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,810
Is t1 a necessary condition for t2?

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,570
Then that would be the case if all nodes

00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:16,490
from which t2 is fireable (that is,
every node from which there is a

00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:21,770
transition labeled t2) are reachable
only by paths in which t1 occurs.

00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,360
That is, to be able to
fire t2 in any way, one

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,860
must have fired t1 at least once
beforehand, starting from m0.

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,600
To be able to check this in the reachability
graph, it would have to be finite.

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,520
Then you can just look at it.

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,660
Look at every point where t2
occurs and ask whether the node

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,550
from which t2 is fired can also be reached
via paths in which t1 does not occur.

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,740
Then t1 would not
be a necessary condition.

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,890
Otherwise, t1 would be a
necessary condition for t2.

00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,420
Let's look at this with an example.

00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:02,990
Here we have a simple Petri net with
four places and four transitions.

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,570
And we can ask whether any transitions

00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,030
are necessary conditions for others.

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,550
We can consider:

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,200
What is possible to fire here?

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,760
First of all, t1 must
be fired in this Petri net.

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,530
And from this it already follows that t1
is a necessary condition for the others.

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,140
Every execution which would be
possible would be like this:

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,260
One must fire t1, then one
has a token here and here.

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,250
After that one can
alternatively fire t2 or t3.

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,930
Both are activated
independently of each other.

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,710
In any case, this would
result in a token here.

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,650
After that, one could
still put a second token

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,570
there by the other transition or fire
t4, if necessary at the end also twice.

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,550
But what we already see:

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:51,680
Possible sequences are t1, t2, t4;

00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:59,120
t1, t2, t3, t4; t1, t3, t4; t1, t3, t2, t4;
t1, t3, t2, t4, t4 and t1, t2, t3, t4, t4.

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,700
That would be all the firing
sequences that are possible.

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,480
And we see:

00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,500
In these firing sequences, for example, t2
never appears without t1 appearing first.

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,490
However, t2 does appear
without t3 appearing first.

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,100
That is, t1 is
a necessary condition for t2,

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,060
but neither t3 is a necessary
condition for t2 nor vice versa.

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,770
The t2 and t3 do not depend on each
other, but they do depend on t1.

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:32,280
And of course also t4 as the last
firing transition depends on t1.

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,490
So for example you could
find it also for t2 and t3,

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,570
but I wrote down here: t1 is
a necessary condition for t4.

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:46,890
Let's actually look at this in
the associated reachability graph.

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,075
It looks like this.

00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:53,400
You have to believe me that I have
drawn it completely correctly.

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,960
And there we see, for example:

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,875
If we look for t4, t4 occurs
in several places, namely

00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,350
here, here, here and here.

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,920
And if we look at the
corresponding nodes, in which t4

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,500
is activated (that would be this
one, this one, this one and

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,250
this one), then they can only be
reached via paths in which t1 occurs.

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,730
Because t1 is the bottleneck
that must be fired first.

00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,950
On the other hand, it
is not true, for example,

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,990
that every node from which t4 is fireable is
only reachable by paths in which t2 occurs.

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,640
So for this node, for example, it's true.

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,480
Here I can fire t4, and before
that I have fired both t1 and t2.

00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,570
However, there are also
nodes, for example this

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,950
one, where t4 is fireable and
where I never executed t2 before.

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,930
Then you can't say that t2 is a
necessary condition for t4; but t1 is.

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,000
So t2 is not
a necessary condition for t4,

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,140
because not every firing sequence
that leads to t4 contains t2.

00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,955
I had just shown
this in the reachability graph.

00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:03,930
There was a firing sequence (namely t1,
t3) that was used to reach a node from

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,830
which t4 could be fired, and
t2 had not appeared before.

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:14,340
So according to this definition then t2
would not be a necessary condition for t4.

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,550
And the same is true for t3.

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,380
So also t3 is not
a necessary condition for t4.

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,900
Because there are
firing sequences (namely

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,260
t1, t2) after which t4 is fireable
without t3 having occurred before.

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,760
Here is the reachability graph again.

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,200
You could use it to check
for the other cases discussed

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,530
and for all combinations of transitions:

00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,030
Is this transition a necessary
condition for that transition?

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,740
Of course, this will also be
practiced on other examples.

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,890
And finally, a
remark about causality, which

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,590
is relevant because this
is an observation that

00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,640
we will also consider for other properties
such as concurrency and conflict.

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,570
Causality is transitive in the sense that,
for example, order relations are transitive.

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,340
This should be a familiar
concept at least for the

00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,990
Komedia students from the
lecture Mathematical Structures.

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,950
But probably also to the other students
from other mathematics lectures.

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:32,700
So it's quite obviously true, or
you can deduce from the definition,

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,300
that if, for example, t1 is a
necessary condition for t2 and t2 is a

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,555
necessary condition for t3, then t1
is also a necessary condition for t3.

00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:43,650
So that continues.

00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,090
If something is necessary,
and what is achieved by it

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,830
is necessary for something else, then
also in that case t1 is necessary for t3.

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,270
So to speak, the other way
around is not necessarily true.

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:04,290
So just because t1 is necessary
for t3 and for example t1 is also

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,890
necessary for t2, this does not mean that
this t2 in between is also necessary for t3.

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,240
In fact, this can also be
considered in the example just seen.

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,770
There t1 was necessary for
t2, and t1 necessary for t3,

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:22,170
and also t1 necessary for t4, but
neither t2 nor t3 were necessary for t4.

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:28,230
So this is only valid in this if-then
direction, not in the opposite direction.
