00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
We come to the next
property to be discussed in

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,890
Petri nets, namely
the concept of conflict.

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,500
This is again about two transitions,
which can be in conflict or not.

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,220
This is again relative
to a given marking.

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,440
So we need a Petri net with a given

00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,350
marking, and then we can say
whether two transitions are in conflict.

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,040
And you can already see here,
in the definition, the word "concurrent" appears.

00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,240
That is, this definition builds
on the concept of concurrency.

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,910
Two transitions are in conflict
if they are not activated

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,700
concurrently, but this is only because
they somehow get in each other's way.

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,280
So it can also be that
t and t' are not activated concurrently,

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,490
because one of the two
transitions itself is not activated.

00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,750
Then it would not be a conflict.

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,150
So it is called a conflict
for two transitions t, t', if

00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,410
they are both activated separately,
but they are not activated concurrently.

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,230
That is, each one could fire,
but they cannot both fire concurrently.

00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:12,210
Because they are in conflict, or rather,
that is how a conflict is defined.

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,780
So exactly
this descriptive consideration.

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,600
This is then checked
with the pre-weight functions.

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,320
What is concurrent, we
have just discussed sufficiently.

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,480
And when a single transition is activated (i.e.
when you look at both of them individually),

00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,840
we have also already discussed,
a few weeks ago even.

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,120
Okay, so how can there be a conflict?

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,310
The two transitions must have at least
one place in common in the precondition.

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:49,520
You can think that whenever we
have two transitions in conflict, there

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,300
must be a common
place in the precondition.

00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,550
So there must be a place s such
that both the pre-weight function for t with

00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:04,580
respect to s requires at least one
token and the pre-weight function for t'.

00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,610
If this is not so, and
moreover t and t' are both

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,340
activated separately, then they
would also be activated concurrently.

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,960
However, this below does not mean

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,320
that one can take this as
the sole criterion to find conflicts.

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,100
It's just an indication of
a conflict again, so to speak.

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,020
So to suspect a conflict for
t and t' only makes sense if

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,080
they have at least one
common place in the preconditions.

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,990
It is not true that as soon
as there is such a common place in

00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,930
the preconditions, there must
also be a conflict.

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,230
So, the presence of a conflict
must always be checked using the definition.

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:53,570
Okay, an example: a Petri
net with a certain marking.

00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,790
Now one can ask which
transitions are in conflict here.

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,840
And this is a term again only for pairs.

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,050
There are only the
pairs (t1,t2), (t2,t3) and (t1,t3)

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,420
here for which it makes sense to wonder.

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,420
And already when we look at t1 and
t2, it turns out that they are in conflict.

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,910
And we also already see what
this can only be due to.

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,040
It can only be
because of this common place.

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,540
That is the only common place.

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,120
So somehow it could cause a conflict.

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,350
It doesn't have to, but it could.

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,290
For example, it wouldn't cause a
conflict if there were two tokens.

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,830
But as drawn here, there is a conflict.

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:39,290
And the check is simple using
the definition for activation and concurrency.

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,960
Yes, so t1 must be activated.

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,170
That is, the pre-weight function
for t1 (that would be this

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,450
one, because t1 requires exactly
one token each from s1 and

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,850
s2; those are the two arrows
here) is less-equal than the current marking.

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,890
The current marking has (1,1,1,1) on
s1 through s4 and then three zeros.

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,050
And this inequality here holds because at

00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,760
each position there is a number on the
left that is no larger than on the right.

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,090
And that's the definition
of t1 being activated.

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,670
That showed up relatively early in
the lecture classes on Petri nets.

00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,020
Very similarly, t2 is also activated.

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,540
Because there the
pre-weight function looks a

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,010
little bit different (because t2 requires a
token from s2 and s3 each), but also

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,495
this pre-weight function is
smaller-equal than the current marking.

00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:36,690
On the other hand, t1
and t2 are not activated concurrently.

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,130
Because for this the sum of these two
pre-weight functions (here again written down as a sum)

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,080
would also have to be
smaller-equal than the current marking.

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,310
And this is just not the case.

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,100
Because although there are two and two,
that is four tokens, on the left

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,700
and four tokens on the
right, it does not fit position-wise.

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,180
So the sum here would
be (1,2,1) and then all zeros.

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,330
But (1,2,1) does
not fit here "underneath".

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,995
That means, t1 and t2
are actually not activated concurrently.

00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:09,420
But they are individually activated,
and therefore they are in conflict.

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,920
We also know:

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,570
As soon as we would put another
token on here, both transitions would still be

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,620
activated individually and they would
also be activated simultaneously/parallel together.

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,290
That means, there would be
concurrency and just no conflict.

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,200
But as it is here, there
is the conflict between t1 and t2.

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,910
One can also consider that of
course t2 and t3 are in conflict.

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,930
Yes, there the picture is very similar, there
it's simply a matter of these three precondition places.

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,300
And then there's the problem here
that s3 only has one token, but

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,800
if we add the pre-weight functions of
t2 and t3, we would need a 2.

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,190
So t2 and t3 are also in
conflict, but t1 and t3 are not.

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,120
So, if we consider t1
and t3 as the relevant pair,

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,690
then we can do these sums here.

00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,710
It says (1,1,0,0).

00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,460
Here it says (0,0,1,1,0,0,0).

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,968
Yes, this then belongs here to t3,
this and this place are occupied.

00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:08,340
Also this and this place
corresponds to a 1 in the

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,960
pre-weight, and then the sum would be
(1,1,1,1,0,0,0), and that would still fit under here.

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,660
That is, t1 and t3 are, after all,
activated concurrently, so they cannot be in conflict.

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:26,850
And also with the indication
from the previous slide, we know:

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,146
t1 and t3 can't be in conflict
anyway because they don't share a precondition place.

00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:36,390
Yes, t1 depends only on these two
pre-condition places, t3 depends only on these.

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,940
There's no potential for conflict there.

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,980
Or you just do the math.

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,040
Okay, and this is again an observation

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,910
that we had already looked
at with causality and concurrency respectively.

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,300
With causality, we had noted
that that's a transitive term.

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,610
So if t1 is causal for t2, and t2 is
causal for t3, then t1 is also causal for t3.

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,390
With concurrency, we had
seen, this is not the case.

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,580
And this is also not
the case with the conflict relation.

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,000
So, it can be: t1 and t2 are in conflict,

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,610
t2 and t3 are in conflict,
but t1 and t3 are not.

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,620
That's exactly what we see here.

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:20,340
Okay, and that's all I've prepared
on conflict in examples here now.

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:27,300
Because the examples would be
very similar to the concurrency examples,

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,530
but just turned around in each case
so that there is just no concurrency.

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,890
So as soon as we have two
transitions, which are each activated.

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,030
Otherwise it's boring.

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,710
They must be each activated.

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,860
But they are not concurrent,
so they are automatically in conflict.

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,750
More on this in the exercise sessions, of course.
