00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,850
So as a final
example, another UML state diagram

00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,910
to be translated into
a flat state diagram.

00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,430
What do we have in front of us now?

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,920
Here again we have no regions, so
it's a bit like example 1, still without

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,200
regions, but this time with
a history node (namely that one).

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,760
So like here no regions,

00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,640
but a hierarchical state and history
(in the specific case, flat history).

00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,530
So what we don't have as an example is a

00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,680
combination where both
regions and history occur.

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,830
And in fact, we
won't have that interacting occur

00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,410
in our flat-knock examples
that you're supposed to solve.

00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,160
We have the simple case with no
regions and no history, the intermediate case

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,240
with regions and no history, and we
have the case with no regions but history.

00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,890
These are our examples 1, 2,

00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,380
3, and you should be able
to do the same for analogous examples.

00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,280
What will be the approach
to deal with the example?

00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,860
First, again as in the simple case,

00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:21,070
that is, as in example 1 (that is,
what was here as an approach, as a strategy):

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,680
Keep the simple states,

00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,950
translate things that occur at the
edge of these hierarchical states appropriately,

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,150
keep the entries and exits, other transitions
(that do not somehow affect the edge,

00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,220
but for example such transitions outside
or such transitions inside) simple, and keep

00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:49,090
the outer start state also as
the start state (while the inner start

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,950
states can disappear and are at
most used to translate entries correctly).

00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,110
This will also be the basic strategy.

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,230
Of course, having this
history node changes something.

00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,240
And what has to change there?

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,290
Well, if we leave
such a hierarchical state that

00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:15,610
has a history node in it, then we
know that if we're going to come back here

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,960
later, and in particular we're
going to do that via a

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,825
history entry, then we would need to know
where we were last in that hierarchical state.

00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:33,100
So if we leave the state via e, we
still have to know later when we return whether

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,230
we left this hierarchical state from C
or from D. How can we remember that?

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,940
How can we remember this?

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,830
Only in states of the flat state diagram.

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,630
I.e., we have to remember, if we go to

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,600
A, whether we are in A now

00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,090
and have been in C last, or whether we
are in A and have been in D last.

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,040
I.e., we will create copies of A.

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,080
One for the fact that we know:

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,450
We are now in A,
but previously we were in C.

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,216
And analogously one for:

00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:09,190
We are in A and were previously in D.

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,330
That is, because of this history node
(in order to be able to return to

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,130
the appropriate place later), we must make copies
of the outer states and also of their transitions.

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,430
To be able to remember
what the last inner sub-state

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,690
was and return to it.

00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:30,340
To be able to use that
information when we have a re-entry

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:40,105
into that hierarchical state via history.

00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:42,280
That's our approach now,
a little more complex.

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,230
What does that mean
specifically in the example?

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,120
Again:

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,750
This is what we're dealing with.

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,970
And first, in the simple
case, we want to keep

00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,410
things outside (the
simple states) essentially.

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,365
That first leads to the fact
that we can start like this.

00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:06,220
That we keep the basic states A,
B, C, D, X and already know that

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,518
we're not really going
to need that starting state.

00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:09,310
We can remove it later.

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,910
That was an inner one.

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,770
And the outer one we're going to

00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,840
use to also have it as the
starting state for the whole flat state diagram.

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,310
That's what we're seeing here.

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,700
We're also already seeing, as a reminder:

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,370
In the simple case, we can
keep transitions that don't have anything

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,940
to do with entering or
exiting to/from a hierarchical state.

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,890
That's sort of the part where we say:

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,140
Other transitions, which therefore do not have anything
to do with entries or exits, are kept.

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:48,490
That means in this concrete case that
we can keep these and these transitions

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:55,270
because they don't somehow touch
the edge of a hierarchical state.

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,440
Then we are here.

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,240
The outer starting state, we can
also just take advantage of that.

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,160
And we don't need this one in here.

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,800
It's only needed if we
have an entry into this

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,970
part via a standard entry,
which would be this one.

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,280
So because that was the
starting state of this inner complex,

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,990
and there was a standard entry
there from X, we get this transition.

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,970
This corresponds to the information: standard entry
under the start state, therefore this transition.

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,300
What else do we have to translate?

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,540
We know that we always get
to A from here with e.

00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,950
That's what we see here.

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,900
There's a transition that no matter if we're
in C or D, we always get to A.

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,430
That would be the easy one.

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,260
However, we know that we still have to
remember whether we came from C or from D.

00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,150
I.e., it is not enough
just to have this transition here.

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,970
We also have to remember this extra information that will
let us know later (when we come back from B,

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,120
for example) that we are really supposed
to come back to D and not C.

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,730
So that's if we come here from D
with e and then come back with b.

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,810
Then we want to end up at D.

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,820
However, if we did that from C, which

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,460
would be possible, then we
want to come back to C.

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,000
That would be exactly
what this history accomplishes.

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,750
If we came from D with e and later came back
with b via history, we want to end up at D.

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,721
If we did that from C, we
also want to end up at C.

00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,770
That is, it is not enough simply
to have this b and e transition.

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,560
We also have to somehow hold that
this is why we are returning to

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,640
D, because we had come to A from D. And there is just the
idea that if we do that from C, we will end up at C, too.

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,550
And there's just the idea that we do
that by capturing that in the states as well.

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,920
So it's not just A, it's
that A that we entered from D.

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,930
So in the outer states, in the A and
the B and strictly speaking also in the X,

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,690
we remember by an extra annotation

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,630
from which sub-state of
the hierarchical state we came.

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,410
That's where more states come from, because we
have to do that for C as well.

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,010
We just create copies.

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,620
What were in the UML state diagrams
A, B, for that we have two copies:

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,740
one for the fact that we came from C
and one for the fact that we came from D.

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,510
Strictly speaking, we could
also create three copies,

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,070
namely in case we could also end up
here without ever having been in C or D.

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,005
So one copy for: we were last here in C.

00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:57,460
One for: we were last here in D.

00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,620
One for: we haven't been
to this part at all.

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,240
That's what I did for the
X, created a copy here where

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,580
I don't write anything in the brackets
because that's supposed to be the information:

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,380
Here we are in X and we
have never been in this part at all.

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,650
In this specific case, it happens that

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,310
we are never in X
if we have been here before.

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,910
That's why I didn't create copies of
X for C and D as well,

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,710
but only for this simple case.

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,670
And analogously for A and B I created only
the copies for: we were in C and D respectively.

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,320
And not another copy for: we
have never been in this hierarchical state.

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,420
This cannot happen at
all in the concrete example.

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,500
That explains why we have these
two copies here of A and B,

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,130
but don't have additional copies for X.

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,680
These are the additional states.

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,750
And we also know that of
course we need the transitions in between.

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,140
So:

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,080
That we can switch between A
and B with a and f,

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,480
that is not changed by whether we
have been in D or in C before.

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,950
That also follows from the strategy here, that
we create these copies of the outer states (in

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,822
that case, of A and B) and their transitions;
these two a, f transitions, which we find both

00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:11,919
here and here; and then for completion,
these states still have to be bound.

00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:11,945
When do we get to A(C)?

00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:35,140
When we have been last in C
and then took this e-transition leading to A.

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,740
When we take this transition
and have been in C last.

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,660
That's why we have this transition.

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,190
And we then use the information that
we've been in C when, again, we

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,190
want to go from B to D at some point
with b. So, if we take that transition at some point.

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,370
So if we take this
transition at some point, via history

00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:01,960
nodes, and have last been in C, we also want
to return to C. And this happens through this additional transition.

00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,870
And that is done
by this additional arrow.

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,540
That's where we use information, whether we
were last in C or in D, to

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,160
be able to return there.

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:31,390
So that's the solution to
this example using this approach

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:39,460
or this essential idea in particular,
to remember in the outer states whether

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,980
or from which sub-state of
the hierarchical state you got there.

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:52,510
To then be able to exploit that when you
have a history entry like here in the example.
