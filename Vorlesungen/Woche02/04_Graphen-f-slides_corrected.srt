00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,190
In the last video, I talked about
the fact that we will mainly model with diagrams.

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,830
And I also mentioned that these
will usually be graph structures somehow.

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,420
You know graphs, at least intuitively.

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,590
Perhaps you have also looked
at them more formally in

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,510
school mathematics lessons, for example.

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,480
First of all, graphs
are, vividly, net-like structures,

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,170
consisting of nodes and edges,
which together form a structure.

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,890
There are different kinds of graphs.

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,510
Here is just an example.

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,400
This one is directed, insofar as

00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,150
the edges each have an end,
which is marked by an arrow.

00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,450
There are also graphs where this is
irrelevant, where you just have the connection

00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,400
without specifying
a particular direction.

00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,640
There is the possibility,
which is not realized here,

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,540
that there are multiple edges
between the same two nodes.

00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,230
Because maybe there are supposed to be different paths,
or maybe an outward path and a return path.

00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,700
That does not occur here now.

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,170
But that is mathematically allowed.

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,780
We can have node labels and edge labels.

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,410
Here we have the nodes labeled with
numbers and the edges labeled with letters.

00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,550
Both are optional in
general or could be designed differently.

00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,230
Graphs can, in
principle, be mathematically infinite.

00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,320
Of course, we will generally be dealing
with finite graphs rather than infinite ones, because

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,540
our models are supposed to be finite.

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,480
So, there are
different varieties of graphs.

00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,600
But they all have
this basic feature in common,

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,340
the idea of expressing facts
by nodes and intermittent edges.

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,890
And not surprisingly, graphs can
be used well for modeling.

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,670
On the one hand, conceivably for
static modeling, when the goal is

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,000
to describe the nature of a system.

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,560
Then, for example, the nodes could
stand for individual components of the

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,860
system, and the relationships between these components
could then be represented by the edges.

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,670
Or for dynamic
modeling, one could imagine

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,490
that the nodes are individual states.

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:15,360
So in each case, the expression of
the entirety of the system at a concrete

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,520
time would be such a state (instead
of the entire graph representing the state).

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,830
And the edges would then be
transitions between individual states of the system.

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,030
So descriptive, for example, of
how the system evolves over time.

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,600
Or under which conditions, which
might be written on these edges,

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,480
the system makes a state transition
from one specific expression to another.

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:47,160
So much in general about
the role that graphs might have.

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,220
Then I'm going to do an
example now, which may seem a

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,910
little artificial, a little far-fetched,
especially as a modeling example.

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,600
It's also not related to computer science,
so it's not a computer science system.

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,730
And strictly speaking,
you could also say:

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,780
It's just a little puzzle.

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,600
A little puzzle that some
of you may already know.

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,990
Possibly from the computer science
pre-course, similar things are done there.

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,180
Maybe just from other contexts,
even if it's from school.

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,080
I'm doing it here because it allows me
in a very naive way to show a

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,150
little bit of this abstraction process.

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,520
And just finding notation for a concrete
problem, and then representing that as a graph.

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,750
So bringing graphs into play
to ultimately solve that problem.

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,960
So you can say it
doesn't involve much modeling.

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,330
But about the transition graphs, the
one that's going to occur here now,

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,080
that's already alluding to
something that we're going to use later.

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,570
Both with Petri nets
and with UML state diagrams.

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,980
That's why I'm doing this example,
not because it's a realistic

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,290
modeling problem.

00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,030
So, what is the problem?

00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,910
Wolf-goat-cabbage, it says right here.

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,440
So, we have a puzzle world like that.

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,480
There's the farmer who
wants to cross a river.

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,230
He has these three things, or
animals (wolf, goat, and cabbage), with him.

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,000
He wants to cross the river, as I said.

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,900
There is a boat for this purpose.

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,710
But there is only room
for two in the boat.

00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:21,810
So for the farmer himself (because the other
three, neither wolf nor goat nor cabbage, can

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:28,110
row themselves; therefore the farmer must always
go with them) and only one of his possessions.

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,960
So, in particular, not
two of these possessions.

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,740
And the problem now is
that the goat would like

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,575
to eat the cabbage, and the
wolf would like to eat the goat.

00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:43,590
So if the farmer crosses the river
with the cabbage, then the wolf and

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,870
the goat would be alone and
the wolf would eat the goat.

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,050
And since only the farmer can row,
and he can cross the river either

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,860
alone or with an animal or the
cabbage head, now the question would be:

00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,130
Is it possible for
the farmer to cross the

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,400
river without losing
one of his possessions?

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,640
What might one want
to model here, anyway?

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,840
Well, for example, the actors that
occur here, that make up the system.

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,940
Relationships between the actors.

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,130
Maybe start state and goal state,
and of course the behavior, the actions.

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,900
What kind of things could happen.

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,500
How states can evolve, and how
to get from start to finish, perhaps.

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,990
So, not start and finish, just
left and right of the river.

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,270
But actually, as start:

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,450
The farmer is on
one side with his property.

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,290
And finish:

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,240
The farmer is on the
other side with all his possessions.

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,430
So in a sense, of
course, it's not necessarily a modeling

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,890
problem, but rather a way to get
more familiar with graphs using an example.

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,890
That's at least how I'm going to use it.

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,500
So, naively:

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,690
First, static model.

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,660
Who are the actors and objects involved?

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,860
Exactly these four.

00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,470
There is still little structure
here, or no structure at all.

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,780
It's just a set of four
elements, not really a graph either.

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,700
Naively, it is also a graph, which just
consists of four nodes and no edges at all.

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,220
But you wouldn't really call that a graph
now, because you don't have a network structure.

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,670
So that could certainly be
better, more informative in particular.

00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,710
You could represent the
relationships between the individual actors/objects.

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,990
So, let's add a little bit of structure.

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,560
You can ask yourself:

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,240
What are the
relationships that are relevant?

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:35,640
And well, from the puzzle description, there
are two relationships in particular that are conceivable.

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,720
On the one hand, the
possession relationship, so:

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,320
The farmer has wolf, goat, and cabbage.

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,000
So here is "owns", even though
"owns" was not explicitly mentioned in the puzzle text.

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,120
There was something about "has with him" and
"shall therefore take with him across the river".

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,310
That is, so to
speak, the first relationship.

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,260
And then there are these relationships,

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,350
these eating relationships, which are obviously
also somehow relevant to the puzzle.

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,900
We need to know who is
eating whom, so that we can

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,600
decide which situations are
safe and which are not.

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,430
So, we know:

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,674
Wolf eats goat.

00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,180
Goat eats cabbage.

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,620
We know, fortunately, that the
wolf would not eat the farmer.

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,140
Not even if he was
alone in the boat with him.

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,220
And we also know that
the wolf doesn't eat the cabbage.

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,180
Although it says "eats" and "eats", it is
not directly true that the wolf eats the cabbage.

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,850
This is also important, otherwise
we could not solve the riddle.

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,220
Now, you might ask yourself:

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,510
Why should I do this at all?

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,070
To capture the puzzle.

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,860
But perhaps one of the purposes of
modeling here might be to then be

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,440
able to describe situations to which the
solution to this problem would be transferable.

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,460
So you would have
other animals, other actors,

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,490
but with analogous or
only slightly different eating relationships.

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,220
One could then ask oneself:

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,540
How analogous are the two situations?

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,790
For example, can a solution to this
problem be transferred to a similar problem?

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,150
Then it is not so important which picture
is here, but the relations are the relevant thing.

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,470
And that's why it might be
interesting to model and capture that here.

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,740
That would be the static side.

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,590
After all, a bit of somehow
visualizing the verbal text from the problem description.

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,800
The dynamic part
is certainly more interesting.

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,740
So we have to
talk about the individual situations.

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,070
And it makes sense to
first show the initial situation

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,780
before crossing the river.

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,740
Again, first naively as a picture.

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,860
Here in the middle is
the river, here is the boat.

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,560
The problem description does not explicitly state that

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,150
the boat is on the left side of the river
in the beginning.

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,830
But if the puzzle should be
solvable at all, it is certainly

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,990
understandable that the boat should be
with the farmer in the beginning.

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,670
So we decided to show that here as well.

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,150
And we also know that
all four actors are on the

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,670
same side at the beginning,
namely where the boat is.

00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,220
So that the puzzle can be
solved in a meaningful way at all.

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,620
What is the target situation?

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,500
Well, it looks like this.

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,400
The river is still there, of course.

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,100
But all four actors, and also the boat,
are, at the end, on the right side.

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,810
Strictly speaking, the same applies here:

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,410
The problem description does not require that the
boat is on the right at the end.

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,830
The problem description would not
care where the boat is.

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,290
So, even a situation where
these four actors are on the

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,730
right, but the boat is on the
left, would be a solution to the problem.

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,710
But with a little bit of
thinking, you might realize:

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,090
That can't happen at all.

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,730
So such a situation
will not be achievable.

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,240
That's why we can say:

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,940
This has to be the
goal; there is no other way.

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,380
Also, that these three actors/objects end up
on the right side is

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,340
not explicitly in the problem
description (in the puzzle text).

00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,680
But it said that the farmer has them
with him and would like to cross the river.

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,310
And from this we conclude
that he naturally wants to

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,960
arrive with his three possessions on
the right side of the river.

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,780
Therefore, it is justified
to consider that as the

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,240
only target situation to be reached.

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,780
So those would be the two situations.

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,820
That would still be
static modeling in a sense.

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,570
And dynamic would be,
now, if we deal with

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,615
how we can get back
and forth between the situations.

00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:29,200
After all, we can't say:

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,220
"We get from here to there."

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,120
Obviously, we can't.

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,920
That's not legal, just to say:

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,030
Yes, the four actors
cross the river by boat.

00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,100
Then we wouldn't
have captured the problem.

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,200
So instead, we have
to describe more fine-grained, so

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,060
to speak, individual transitions
that are really allowed.

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,920
For example, we might say:

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:55,120
In the first step, let the farmer cross
the river with the wolf in the boat.

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,510
That's what the arrows
here are supposed to indicate.

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,171
What will happen then?

00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:06,310
Hopefully, it will
look like this afterwards.

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,130
The first step is over.

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,360
We would now want to
think about the second step.

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,510
So:

00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,590
What could the farmer do next
after he brings the wolf over there?

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,990
He can't do anything, because
the second step happens immediately:

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,790
Namely, the goat eats the cabbage.

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,800
This eating happens immediately,

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:36,350
without any possibility of the
farmer intervening somehow through action.

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,320
This can also be read from the
riddle text, if you read it generously, that

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,460
this eating happens in such a
way that the farmer cannot prevent it.

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,900
He can't call over and say:

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,650
"Leave it."

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,250
Then the puzzle would be uninteresting if
he could stop the goat from a distance.

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,890
He can only do that if he
is where the goat and the cabbage are.

00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:02,480
Our real goal, of course,
is to write this down more

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,890
clearly now, instead of
always taking pictures like this.

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,160
For that, we want
to use graphs now.

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,530
And of course, we do that just
to have a notation that goes beyond

00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,950
these pictures that have to
be painted over and over again.

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:21,800
For this, we distinguish, in modeling
and ultimately also in programming (so also

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,800
in other lectures you will
encounter these terms): syntax and semantics.

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,200
So the syntax, the symbols, the
forms (in our case often diagrams),

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,440
which one may use for
the representation of the model.

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,290
So in this naive example just
now, of course, these would be

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:41,360
the pictures that we saw: the blue area
for the river, the picture of the goat, etc.

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,180
And the semantics would be what
is behind these diagrams, shapes, symbols.

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,450
So the blue area is actually the river.

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,520
It separates the two sides.

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,380
It has some effect,
because, for example, the river

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,480
prevents the farmer from influencing what's
on the other side, and so on.

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,270
And the arrows that we
have seen here are also symbols.

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:14,150
They are there to express the
actual action, the step of crossing.

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,380
That would be the
semantics of these arrows, etc.

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:27,290
Here, of course, it was all very intuitive,
so one might not even consider it

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,900
necessary to work out
what syntax and semantics are.

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,430
But in general, of course, it is.

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,430
It's not always so clear.

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,170
So for a syntax there
is not always a corresponding semantics.

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,200
In our example, on the one hand, we
can say that the semantics is quite vague.

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,750
On the other hand, the problem
is so simple that just by looking

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,030
at it, you have an
idea of what's going on.

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:56,430
In general, of course, one
would want to capture that somehow.

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,030
What is desirable in general is

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,060
that this meaning of symbols
and shapes is very precise.

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,300
So that different modelers,
or different viewers of the

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,870
model, can understand that respectively,
and in the same way.

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,440
For this, a common language/notation is

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,610
useful, common visual description
forms to avoid misunderstandings.

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:25,890
And indeed, graphs form such a

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,260
possible language/notation
for many contexts.

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,540
That is why they form the basis
for many modeling techniques designed in graph form.

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,085
Such a definition can, of course,
happen exactly for one concrete example.

00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,350
So: We model
this wolf-goat-cabbage-head problem,

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,760
and for it, we record what
the notation and symbols should be.

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,840
It is even more useful in practice

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,060
if one can describe the entire
modeling approach in a unified manner.

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,290
Petri nets will be something like that.

00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,130
This will be a modeling approach
that has a fixed syntax and semantics.

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,785
So they are independent of the
specific system that one is modeling.

00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:05,550
This can be explained in general terms, for
example, be described in a book, and then quite

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,980
different problems, systems, models can be
followed and described with this approach.

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,650
Then, syntax and semantics
are unified across multiple models.

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,760
Otherwise, again as a reminder:

00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,770
Of course, graphs are not
the only way to create uniformity.

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,480
Mathematics does that, too.

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:37,170
So with textual formulas, with logic,
you can of course specify things, model

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,920
things, and also have
a common formal basis.

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,740
But here we will mainly work with graphs.

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,760
Now it didn't always look like a graph.

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,770
But, of course,
our previous representation

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,100
for this problem is also just
a cover for the graph.

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,560
So, let's go back to the static modeling.

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,650
There, we had this picture,
with the arrows in between.

00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,805
That was a graph, of course.

00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,410
So these
relationships between the farmer,

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,480
the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage, we
could represent with this graph.

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,640
The edges are labeled with
the relationships between the nodes, which

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,420
are labeled with the names of the actors.
(W = wolf; Z = goat; K = cabbage)

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:31,770
This is simply the same picture as
the one here, only now these photos are replaced with symbols.

00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:38,040
It's totally obvious and clear,
just a little more abstract.

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:47,580
And of course, here again, for example:
there is no transition from wolf to cabbage with "eats".

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,600
That expresses the same fact as before.

00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,100
That would be it for static modeling.

00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,080
What about the dynamic modeling?

00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,250
There, I had also already said:

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,590
Then, you would consider the nodes as
states and the edges as transitions between them.

00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:11,550
So a bit like the step from
here to here suggested by the arrows.

00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,180
You would then actually have
two explicit nodes in the

00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,390
graph, and this arrow would
go from state to state.

00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,120
Classical representatives of this, that
is, using graphs for dynamic modeling,

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,830
are so-called flat state diagrams.

00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,330
They are often also
called transition systems.

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,270
They are often
just called state diagrams.

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,740
In the lecture, I always
explicitly say "flat statecharts" until

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,410
we get to UML statecharts.

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,170
To make the difference

00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,380
clear, namely that UML statecharts
are not flat, in that sense.

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,550
They have more structure than
just nodes and edges in between.

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,080
That's why, whenever we
have just this node-edge

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
structure, I'll talk
about flat statecharts.

00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,280
I hope that's how
it's uniformly handled in the

00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,280
exercise task collection by now, too.

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,960
What is such a flat state diagram?

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,170
It's actually just a
directed graph, possibly edge-labeled.

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,610
So the nodes are states.

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,100
They'll usually have some
name, some description, some label.

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,450
The graph is supposed to be directed, in
the sense that there are arrows in between.

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,430
Even though this was
still static modeling here.

00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,720
But the edges that we
have are supposed to be directed.

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,310
They could also be labeled.

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:36,350
For example, at the transitions,
it could somehow say which

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,570
action is responsible
for changing the state.

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,470
But that could be optional.

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,050
Maybe it's enough to have the
states as a set of nodes.

00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,970
And the transitions have to be there,

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,840
but they don't have to be
labeled extra, with some label on them.

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,700
Also, you usually want
to highlight a start state,

00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,340
usually with an incoming arrowhead.

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,840
And sometimes we also designate
one or more distinguished end states.

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,210
Then, one wants to express from where to where
one would like to go in the state diagram.

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,510
Let's do that for our little problem.

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,740
So, a flat state diagram
for our wolf-goat-cabbage problem.

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,300
Then we definitely
have our starting state.

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,650
That's printed a little small here.

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,830
I hope you can still follow this,

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,380
even though I'm not largely
developing this on the whiteboard now.

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,500
What is meant here in each case (this is
also written down again on a slide in a moment):

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,480
The state, which is
abbreviated by the four actors.

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,175
And here there is a
vertical line, which represents the river.

00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:50,620
So what this first state
is supposed to symbolize here:

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,220
Farmer (F), wolf (W), goat (Z), cabbage (K)
are left of the river.

00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,140
This is one possible state, and

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,640
it's the starting state (that's
why it's distinguished by this arrowhead).

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,990
And then you can think:

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,205
What could happen?

00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:14,080
We had noted earlier this one
transition where we come from just

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,120
this situation (which we also just identified
as the start state) to this state.

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,980
That would be the state:

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:31,180
Vertical line, goat and cabbage on the left of
it, farmer and wolf on the right of it.

00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:40,080
So that would be written down as ZK|FW.

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,340
Do we have that in our graph as well?

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:50,100
Yes, so here first:

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,390
We also have a target state.

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,850
But we don't know how to get there yet.

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,740
Somehow we have to take steps.

00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,850
What could be the first step?

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:02,340
For example, the farmer could
drive the goat across the river.

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,980
Right now, this is not
the condition I just showed you.

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,960
This would be the condition that
we identified earlier as the problem.

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,720
Where the farmer crosses
the river with the wolf.

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,500
Then we would have that condition.

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,080
But that's an immediate failure state because
then the goat will eat the cabbage.

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,850
And before that, in any order,
I may have tried other things here.

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,120
So here I don't have to try anything
else, but I had decided here for example:

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,110
Yes, let the farmer cross
the river with the goat.

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,350
That's not a failure state, because
the wolf won't eat the cabbage.

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,360
That would be a possibility.

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,500
And then you could think about:

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,610
What can happen next?

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,710
Now here comes:

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,730
The farmer could go back.

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,870
Then the goat would be left alone.

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:52,650
The farmer could then cross
the river with the wolf.

00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:02,580
So for each of these arrows, for the
transitions, there is a possible step behind it.

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,710
There are also such observations as:

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,350
Except when you've made a step that

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,440
leads to a failure, you
can always turn steps around.

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,080
Then there are two arrows now.

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,180
The farmer can cross the river with
the goat, then he would be here.

00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,340
Then this would be the state.

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,150
But it also works the other way around.

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,480
That is, everywhere we have an
arrow, we can turn it around.

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,120
Except for the failure states, because
you can't get out of them.

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:35,970
They are fatal, literally fatal
to one of the possessions.

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,340
Now, as I said, I don't really

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,910
want to explain or develop
this step by step here now.

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,800
But you can, by trial
and error and following all

00:22:51,800 --> 00:23:00,830
the possibilities, complete this graph and
eventually come to a complete picture.

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,720
This is not yet complete.

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,370
What's still missing here?

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,400
We have all these double
transitions. We have failure states.

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,500
From the success state, of
course, you can make a stupid

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,440
mistake and still spoil it, so to speak.

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,411
That's probably not what the
farmer is going to want.

00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:15,170
So, we would probably say:

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,470
When the farmer reaches this
state, he lets it go.

00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,840
And doesn't move around anymore.

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,820
But purely formally, you could say:

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,730
You can still go from the
success state to the failure state.

00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,960
But something is still missing here.

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,330
And that's because, you
can think about that:

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,850
Actually, the graph has to be symmetric.

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,570
It's completely arbitrary to say that
the farmer wants to go from left to right.

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,470
You could just as well have said that the farmer is on
the right at the beginning and wants to go to the left.

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,950
So then you would have
had to develop this graph

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,140
to start here and end here.

00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,336
And for that, however, the
graph must be completely symmetrical.

00:23:46,336 --> 00:23:50,990
So you have to be able
to mirror it from top to bottom.

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,815
And then transitions are missing,
as you can see here.

00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:56,240
These transitions are still missing.

00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,820
Then the graph
is both left-right symmetric,

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,906
because it is mirrored at this axis, and you
can obviously also mirror it from top to bottom.

00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:15,806
Then it does not look exactly symmetrical
when drawn, but in fact it is.

00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:28,870
So, if you only capture the connections
and not exactly how the arrows were drawn.

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:38,020
Namely, these two transitions correspond to the transitions
from here to here and here to here.

00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,125
Then the graph is indeed symmetrical.

00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:47,800
This is ultimately due to the
fact that intuitively one could reverse

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,270
the feeding relationships and swap
the roles of wolf and cabbage.

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,440
Then the symmetry is
according to this axis.

00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,470
And the symmetry according to
this axis is that it

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,200
wouldn't really matter whether you want left to
right or right to left as a farmer.

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:08,050
The symmetry in terms
of beginning and end.

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,630
So, the notation here was:

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,100
The vertical line represents
the river; on the

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,510
left and on the right are
the actors, whose order doesn't matter.

00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,010
So, I would not make a
difference between the states WKFZ and KWFZ.

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:29,770
Therefore, just always sort the
letters in a certain consistent way.

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,550
Because it wouldn't matter in which order they
are standing there on one side of the river.

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,610
I don't specify the boat at all.

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,790
It appears in the picture before, but
actually I don't need to specify it,

00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,340
because it will always be
where the farmer is anyway.

00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,910
That's why it doesn't show
up in the notation anymore.

00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,000
I had not labelled the transitions here.

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,970
Of course, you could have labelled them
by always writing the action on them.

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,480
For example:

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,070
"The farmer brings the
goat across the river."

00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,110
Think up some name for it, a short

00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,230
label, and write that
on the corresponding arrows.

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,370
I didn't do that here now for clarity.

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,510
I had used the
angular red states for failures.

00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,820
So, for example, when
the goat eats the cabbage.

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,470
Such actions have priority over
crossings in a certain sense, which

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,750
is why there are no
return edges from failure nodes.

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,200
I can't reverse this arrow here,
because in that case it's a failure.

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,430
The goat eats the
cabbage and then nothing works.

00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:36,340
That's why edges leading out
of such states were omitted.

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:42,820
Because they are not allowed according
to the semantics of the problem.

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,440
And this double-blue
ellipse, I had already

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,570
marked as the desired target
state at the very beginning.

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,580
So in a certain way, you
could say here, this is the syntax/semantics

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,040
description for this graph.

00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,060
In general, labels like
that are not redundant.

00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,820
This is really a choice I made here.

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,300
Simply so that the
representation doesn't get more complicated.

00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,560
In general, it can already be

00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,950
very important to have the
labels on the edges as well.

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,410
Also, the colors could be seen
as separate labels in the end.

00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,700
The fact that a node is red
or blue could also be seen as:

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,840
This is yet another label
that is on the node.

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,910
What else can be
seen on this concrete graph?

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:42,700
There are several paths from the
start state to the target state.

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,600
A solution to the problem
would be exactly one path through

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,150
this graph that
somehow follows the arrows.

00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:55,330
Just because of this part of the graph,
where one could always follow the arrows here,

00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,140
it turns out that there are infinitely
many solutions, which also become arbitrarily long.

00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,850
If the farmer somehow always carries out
so to speak senseless actions in this circle,

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,030
before he then decides to go
truly in the direction of the goal.

00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:13,490
From this, you can see that although it is
a finite graph, it contains infinitely many paths.

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,980
In fact, there are infinitely
many, arbitrarily long, successful paths.

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:24,470
The two shortest ones
contain seven transitions each, and

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,600
these are the interesting ones
for the solution of the problem.

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,160
Already this graph has
not been particularly small now.

00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,620
But for interesting actual
systems, such flat state diagrams

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:48,080
can get amazingly large very
quickly, even for relatively simple systems.

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,940
This is called state explosion.

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,610
It simply means that even with
just a few ingredients, there are still

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,490
a lot of possible
states, and correspondingly complicated graphs.

00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,880
And you can't really
avoid that with flat state

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,200
diagrams, because they just represent
all states and all transitions explicitly.

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,880
This will later be a motivation for
the already mentioned UML state diagrams, which

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,370
have extra structure, and therefore can
avoid this explosion to some extent.

00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,070
In our problem, sometimes
in other problems as well,

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:27,620
one can exploit symmetry, for instance, to get a
little bit on top of the state explosion problem.

00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,620
In general, you just
need more powerful modeling tools.

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,850
But let's just work with graphs for now.
